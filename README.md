Idea
----

*This is just a draft!*

I've tried to convert great book
["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](http://learnyouahaskell.com)
by Miran Lipovaƒça into ePub format.

Inspired by [pvorb's repo](https://github.com/pvorb/learn-you-a-haskell).

Howto
-----

To obtain `epub`:

    cd book_src
    sh gen_epub.sh

`learn-you-a-haskell.epub` will appear in the root directory.
