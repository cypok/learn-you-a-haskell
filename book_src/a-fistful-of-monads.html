        <h1>A Fistful of Monads</h1>

<p>
When we first talked about functors, we saw that they were a useful concept for 
values that can be mapped over. Then, we took that concept one step further by 
introducing applicative functors, which allow us to view values of certain data 
types as values with contexts and use normal functions on those values while 
preserving the meaning of those contexts. 
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll learn about 
monads, which are just beefed up applicative functors, much like 
applicative functors are only beefed up functors.
</p>

<img src="lyah/smugpig.png" alt="more cool than u" class="right" width="307" height="186">

<p>
When we started off with functors, we saw that it's possible to map functions 
over various data types. We saw that for this purpose, the <code class="fixed">Functor</code>
type class was introduced and it had us asking the question: when we have a 
function of type <code class="fixed">a -&gt; b</code> and some data type 
<code class="fixed">f a</code>, how do we map that function over the data type 
to end up with <code class="fixed">f b</code>? We saw how to map something over 
a <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code>, a list <code class="fixed">[a]</code>, an <span class="fixed">IO 
a</span> etc. We even saw how to map a function <code class="fixed">a -&gt; b</code> 
over other functions of type <code class="fixed">r -&gt; a</code> to get
functions of type <code class="fixed">r -&gt; b</code>. To answer this question 
of how to map a function over some data type, all we had to do was look at the type
of <code class="fixed">fmap</code>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
And then make it work for our data type by writing the appropriate <span 
class="fixed">Functor</span> instance.
</p>

<p>
Then we saw a possible improvement of functors and said, hey, what if that 
function <code class="fixed">a -&gt; b</code> is already wrapped inside a 
functor value? Like, what if we have <code class="fixed">Just (*3)</code>, how 
do we apply that to <code class="fixed">Just 5</code>? What if we don't want to 
apply it to <code class="fixed">Just 5</code> but to a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span> instead? Or if we have <code class="fixed">[(*2),(+4)]</code>,
how would we apply that to <code class="fixed">[1,2,3]</code>? How would that 
work even? For this, the <code class="fixed">Applicative</code> type class was 
introduced, in which we wanted the answer to the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&lt;*&gt;) :: (Applicative f) =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
We also saw that we can take a normal value and wrap it inside a data type. For 
instance, we can take a
<code class="fixed">1</code> and wrap it so that it becomes a 
<code class="fixed">Just 1</code>. Or we can make it into a <span 
class="fixed">[1]</span>. Or an I/O action that does nothing and just yields
<code class="fixed">1</code>. The function that does this is called <span 
class="fixed">pure</span>.
</p>

<p>
Like we said, an applicative value can be seen as a value with an added context. 
A <i>fancy</i> value, to put it in technical terms. For instance, the character <span 
class="fixed">'a'</span> is just a normal character, whereas <span 
class="fixed">Just 'a'</span> has some added context. Instead of a <span 
class="fixed">Char</span>, we have a <code class="fixed">Maybe Char</code>,
which tells us that its value might be a character, but it could also be an 
absence of a character.
</p>

<p>
It was neat to see how the <code class="fixed">Applicative</code> type class 
allowed us to use normal functions on these values with context and how that 
context was preserved. Observe:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; Just 8
Just 16
ghci&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; Just "klingon" &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; (-) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; [1,2,3]
[2,1,0,3,2,1]
</pre>

<p>
Ah, cool, so now that we treat them as applicative values, <span 
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> values represent computations that might have 
failed, <code class="fixed">[a]</code> values represent computations that have 
several results (non-deterministic computations), <span class="fixed">IO 
a</span> values represent values that have side-effects, etc.
</p>

<p>
Monads are a natural extension of applicative functors and with them we're 
concerned with this: if you have a value with a context, <span class="fixed">m 
a</span>, how do you apply to it a function that takes a normal <span 
class="fixed">a</span> and returns a value with a context? That is, how do you 
apply a function of type <code class="fixed">a -&gt; m b</code> to a value of 
type <code class="fixed">m a</code>? So essentially, we will want this function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
</pre>

<p>
<b>If we have a fancy value and a function that takes a normal value but 
returns a fancy value, how do we feed that fancy value into the function?</b> This 
is the main question that we will concern ourselves when dealing with monads. We write 
<code class="fixed">m a</code> instead of <code class="fixed">f a</code> because 
the <code class="fixed">m</code> stands for <code class="fixed">Monad</code>, but monads are just 
applicative functors that support <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>. The 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> function is pronounced as <i>bind</i>.
</p>

<p>
When we have a normal value <code class="fixed">a</code> and a normal function 
<code class="fixed">a -&gt; b</code> it's really easy to feed the value to the 
function &mdash; you just apply the function to the value normally and that's 
it. But when we're dealing with values that come with certain contexts, it takes 
a bit of thinking to see how these fancy values are fed to functions and how to 
take into account their behavior, but you'll see that it's easy as one two 
three. 
</p>

<a name="getting-our-feet-wet-with-maybe"></a>
<h2>Getting our feet wet with Maybe</h2>

<img src="lyah/buddha.png" alt="monads, grasshoppa" class="left" width="302" height="387">

<p>
Now that we have a vague idea of what monads are about, let's see if we can make 
that idea a bit less vague.
</p>

<p>
Much to no one's surprise, <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is a monad, so let's 
explore it a bit more and see if we can combine it with what we know about 
monads.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
Make sure you understand <a href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html#applicative-functors">applicatives</a> at this point. It's good if you have a 
feel for how the various <code class="fixed">Applicative</code> instances work 
and what kind of computations they represent, because monads are nothing more 
than taking our existing applicative knowledge and upgrading it.
</div>

<p>
A value of type <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> represents a value of type 
<code class="fixed">a</code> with the context of possible failure attached. A 
value of <code class="fixed">Just "dharma"</code> means that the string <span 
class="fixed">"dharma"</span> is there whereas a value of 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code> represents its absence, or if you look at the 
string as the result of a computation, it means that the computation has failed.
</p>

<p>
When we looked at <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> as a functor, we saw that if 
we want to <code class="fixed">fmap</code> a function over it, it gets mapped 
over the insides if it's a <code class="fixed">Just</code> value, otherwise the 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code> is kept because there's nothing to map it 
over!
</p>

<p>
Like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fmap (++"!") (Just "wisdom")
Just "wisdom!"
ghci&gt; fmap (++"!") Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
As an applicative functor, it functions similarly. However, applicatives also 
have the function wrapped. <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is an applicative 
functor in such a way that when we use <code class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</code> to 
apply a function inside a <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> to a value that's 
inside a <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, they both have to be <span 
class="fixed">Just</span> values for the result to be a <span 
class="fixed">Just</span> value, otherwise the result is <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. It makes sense because if you're missing either 
the function or the thing you're applying it to, you can't make something up out 
of thin air, so you have to propagate the failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 3
Just 6
ghci&gt; Nothing &lt;*&gt; Just "greed"
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just ord &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
When we use the applicative style to have normal functions act on <span 
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values, it's similar. All the values have to be <span 
class="fixed">Just</span> values, otherwise it's all for <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 6
Just 6
ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
And now, let's think about how we would do <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
for <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>. Like we said, <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>
takes a monadic value, and a function that takes a normal value and returns a 
monadic value and manages to apply that function to the monadic value. How does 
it do that, if the function takes a normal value? Well, to do that, it has to 
take into account the context of that monadic value.
</p>

<p>
In this case, <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> would take a <span 
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> value and a function of type <code class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</code>
and somehow apply the function to the <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code>. To 
figure out how it does that, we can use the intuition that we have from <span 
class="fixed">Maybe</span> being an applicative functor. Let's say that we have 
a function <code class="fixed">\x -&gt; Just (x+1)</code>. It takes a number, 
adds <code class="fixed">1</code> to it and wraps it in a <span 
class="fixed">Just</span>:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 1
Just 2
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 100
Just 101
</pre>

<p>
If we feed it <code class="fixed">1</code>, it evaluates to <span 
class="fixed">Just 2</span>. If we give it the number <span 
class="fixed">100</span>, the result is <code class="fixed">Just 101</code>. 
Very straightforward. Now here's the kicker: how do we feed a  
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> value to this function? If we think about how 
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> acts as an applicative functor, answering this 
is pretty easy. If we feed it a <code class="fixed">Just</code> value, take what's inside 
the <code class="fixed">Just</code> and apply the function to it. If give it 
a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, hmm, well, then we're left with a 
function but <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> to apply it to. In that case, 
let's just do what we did before and say that the result is <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling it <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, let's call it 
<code class="fixed">applyMaybe</code> for now. It takes a <span 
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> and a function that returns a <span 
class="fixed">Maybe b</span> and manages to apply that function to the <span 
class="fixed">Maybe a</span>. Here it is in code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyMaybe :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
applyMaybe Nothing f  = Nothing
applyMaybe (Just x) f = f x
</pre>

<p>
Okay, now let's play with it for a bit. We'll use it as an infix function so that 
the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> value is on the left side and the function on 
the right:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just "smile" `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ " :)")
Just "smile :)"
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Nothing
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ " :)")
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, we see that when we used <code class="fixed">applyMaybe</code> with a <code class="fixed">Just</code> value and a function, the function simply got applied to the value inside the <code class="fixed">Just</code>. When we tried to use it with a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, the whole result was <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. 
What about if the function returns a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>? Let's 
see:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Just 3
ghci&gt; Just 1 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Just what we expected. If the monadic value on the left is a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the whole thing is <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. 
And if the function on the right returns a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, 
the result is <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> again. This is very similar to when 
we used <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> as an applicative and we got a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span> result if somewhere in there was a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<p>
It looks like that for <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, we've figured out how 
to take a fancy value and feed it to a function that takes a normal value and 
returns a fancy one. We did this by keeping in mind that a <span 
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value represents a computation that might have 
failed.
</p>

<p>
You might be asking yourself, how is this useful? It may seem like applicative 
functors are stronger than monads, since applicative functors allow us to take a 
normal function and make it operate on values with contexts. We'll see that 
monads can do that as well because they're an upgrade of applicative functors,
and that they can also do some cool stuff that applicative functors can't.
</p>

<p>
We'll come back to <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> in a minute, but first, 
let's check out the type class that belongs to monads.
</p>

<a name="the-monad-type-class"></a>
<h2>The Monad type class</h2>

<p>
Just like functors have the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> type class and applicative 
functors have the <code class="fixed">Applicative</code> type class, 
monads come with their own type class: <code class="fixed">Monad</code>! Wow, 
who would have thought? This is what the type class looks like:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Monad m where
    return :: a -&gt; m a

    (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

    (&gt;&gt;) :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
    x &gt;&gt; y = x &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; y

    fail :: String -&gt; m a
    fail msg = error msg
</pre>

<img src="lyah/kid.png" alt="this is you on monads" class="right" width="363" height="451">
<p>
Let's start with the first line. It says <code class="fixed">class Monad m where</code>. 
But wait, didn't we say that monads are just beefed up applicative functors? Shouldn't 
there be a class constraint in there along the lines of <span 
class="fixed">class (Applicative m) = &gt; Monad m where</span> so that a type 
has to be an applicative functor first before it can be made a monad? Well, 
there should, but when Haskell was made, it hadn't occured to people that 
applicative functors are a good fit for Haskell so they weren't in there. But 
rest assured, every monad is an applicative functor, even if the <span 
class="fixed">Monad</span> class declaration doesn't say so.
</p>

<p>
The first function that the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> type class defines 
is <code class="fixed">return</code>. It's the same as <span 
class="fixed">pure</span>, only with a different name. Its type is <span
class="fixed">(Monad m) =&gt; a -&gt; m a</span>. It takes a value and puts it
in a minimal default context that still holds that value. In other words, it
takes something and wraps it in a monad. It always does the same thing as the
<code class="fixed">pure</code> function from the <span
class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class, which means we're already
acquainted with <code class="fixed">return</code>.  We already used <span
class="fixed">return</span> when doing I/O. We used it to take a value and make
a bogus I/O action that does nothing but yield that value.  For <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> it takes a value and wraps it in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span>.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
Just a reminder: <code class="fixed">return</code> is nothing like the 
<code class="fixed">return</code> that's in most other languages. It doesn't end 
function execution or anything, it just takes a normal value and puts it in a 
context.
</div>

<img src="lyah/tur2.png" alt="hmmm yaes" class="left" width="169" height="145">

<p>
The next function is <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, or bind. It's like 
function application, only instead of taking a normal value and feeding it to a 
normal function, it takes a monadic value (that is, a value with a context) and 
feeds it to a function that takes a normal value but returns a monadic value. 
</p>

<p>
Next up, we have <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code>. We won't pay too much 
attention to it for now because it comes with a default implementation and we
pretty much never implement it when making <code class="fixed">Monad</code> 
instances.
</p>

<p>
The final function of the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> type class is 
<code class="fixed">fail</code>. We never use it explicitly in our code. Instead, it's used by Haskell to enable failure in a special syntactic construct for monads that we'll meet later. We don't need to concern ourselves with <code class="fixed">fail</code> too much for now.
</p>

<p>
Now that we know what the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> type class looks 
like, let's take a look at how <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is an instance 
of <code class="fixed">Monad</code>!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad Maybe where
    return x = Just x
    Nothing &gt;&gt;= f = Nothing
    Just x &gt;&gt;= f  = f x
    fail _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
<code class="fixed">return</code> is the same as <span 
class="fixed">pure</span>, so that one's a no-brainer. We do what we did in the 
<code class="fixed">Applicative</code> type class and wrap it in a <span 
class="fixed">Just</span>.
</p>

<p>
The <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> function is the same as our 
<code class="fixed">applyMaybe</code>. When feeding the <span 
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> to our function, we keep in mind the context and 
return a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> if the value on the left is <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span> because if there's no value then there's no way to 
apply our function to it. If it's a <code class="fixed">Just</code> we take 
what's inside and apply <code class="fixed">f</code> to it.
</p>

<p>
We can play around with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> as a monad:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return "WHAT" :: Maybe String
Just "WHAT"
ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Just 90
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Nothing new or exciting on the first line since we already used <span 
class="fixed">pure</span> with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> and we know that <span 
class="fixed">return</span> is just <code class="fixed">pure</code> with a 
different name. The next two lines showcase <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
a bit more.
</p>

<p>
Notice how when we fed <code class="fixed">Just 9</code> to the function <span 
class="fixed">\x -&gt; return (x*10)</span>, the <code class="fixed">x</code> 
took on the value <code class="fixed">9</code> inside the function. It seems as 
though we were able to extract the value from a <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> 
without pattern-matching. And we still didn't lose the context of our <span 
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value, because when it's <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, 
the result of using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> will be <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> as well.
</p>

<h2>Walk the line</h2>

<img src="lyah/pierre.png" alt="pierre" class="left" width="374" height="405">

<p>
Now that we know how to feed a <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> value to a 
function of type
<code class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</code> while taking into account the context 
of possible failure, let's see how we can use <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> repeatedly to handle computations of several 
<code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> values.
</p>

Pierre has decided to take a break from his job at the fish farm and try 
tightrope walking. He's not that bad at it, but he does have one problem: birds 
keep landing on his balancing pole! They come and they take a short rest, chat 
with their avian friends and then take off in search of breadcrumbs. This 
wouldn't bother him so much if the number of birds on the left side of the pole 
was always equal to the number of birds on the right side. But sometimes, all 
the birds decide that they like one side better and so they throw him off
balance, which results in an embarrassing tumble for Pierre (he's using a safety 
net).
</p>

<p>
Let's say that he keeps his balance if the number of birds on the left side of 
the pole and on the right side of the pole is within three. So if there's
one bird on the right side and four birds on the left side, he's okay. But if a 
fifth bird lands on the left side, then he loses his balance and takes a dive.
</p>

<p>
We're going to simulate birds landing on and flying away from the pole and see 
if Pierre is still at it after a certain number of birdy arrivals and 
departures. For instance, we want to see what happens to Pierre if first one 
bird arrives on the left side, then four birds occupy the right side and then 
the bird that was on the left side decides to fly away.
</p>

<p>
We can represent the pole with a simple pair of integers. The first component 
will signify the number of birds on the left side and the second component the 
number of birds on the right side:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Birds = Int
type Pole = (Birds,Birds)
</pre>

<p>
First we made a type synonym for <code class="fixed">Int</code>, called 
<code class="fixed">Birds</code>, because we're using integers to represent 
how many birds there are. And then we made a type synonym <code class="fixed">(Birds,Birds)</code> and we called it <code class="fixed">Pole</code> (not to be 
confused with a person of Polish descent).
</p>

<p>
Next up, how about we make a function that takes a number of birds and lands 
them on one side of the pole. Here are the functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landLeft n (left,right) = (left + n,right)

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landRight n (left,right) = (left,right + n)
</pre>

<p>
Pretty straightforward stuff. Let's try them out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
(2,0)
ghci&gt; landRight 1 (1,2)
(1,3)
ghci&gt; landRight (-1) (1,2)
(1,1)
</pre>

<p>
To make birds fly away we just had a negative number of birds land on one side. Because 
landing a bird on the <code class="fixed">Pole</code> returns a <span 
class="fixed">Pole</span>, we can chain applications of <span 
class="fixed">landLeft</span> and <code class="fixed">landRight</code>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0)))
(3,1)
</pre>

<p>
When we apply the function <code class="fixed">landLeft 1</code> to <span 
class="fixed">(0,0)</span> we get <span 
class="fixed">(1,0)</span>. Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting 
in <code class="fixed">(1,1)</code>. Finally two birds land on the left 
side, resulting in <code class="fixed">(3,1)</code>. We apply a function to 
something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here 
it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we 
make a function like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
x -: f = f x
</pre>

<p>
We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; 100 -: (*3)
300
ghci&gt; True -: not
False
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 2
(2,0)
</pre>

<p>
By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable 
manner:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2
(3,1)
</pre>

<p>
Pretty cool! This example is equivalent to the one before where we repeatedly 
landed birds on the pole, only it looks neater. Here, it's more obvious that we 
start off with <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code> and then land one bird one the 
left, then one on the right and finally two on the left. 
</p>

<p>So far so good, but 
what happens if 10 birds land on one side?
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
(10,3)
</pre>

<p>
10 birds on the left side and only 3 on the right? That's sure to send poor 
Pierre falling through the air! This is pretty obvious here but what if we had a 
sequence of landings like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)
</pre>

<p>
It might seem like everything is okay but if you follow the steps here, you'll 
see that at one time there are 4 birds on the right side and no birds on the 
left! To fix this, we have to take another look at our <span 
class="fixed">landLeft</span> and <code class="fixed">landRight</code> 
functions. From what we've seen, we want these functions to be able to fail. 
That is, we want them to return a new pole if the balance is okay but fail if 
the birds land in a lopsided manner. And what better way to add a context of 
failure to value than by using <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>! Let's rework 
these functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landLeft n (left,right)
    | abs ((left + n) - right) &lt; 4 = Just (left + n, right)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landRight n (left,right)
    | abs (left - (right + n)) &lt; 4 = Just (left, right + n)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Instead of returning a <code class="fixed">Pole</code> these functions now 
return a <code class="fixed">Maybe Pole</code>. They still take the number of 
birds and the old pole as before, but then they check if landing that many birds 
on the pole would throw Pierre off balance. We use guards to check if the 
difference between the number of birds on the new pole is less than 4. If it is, 
we wrap the new pole in a <code class="fixed">Just</code> and return that. If it 
isn't, we return a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, indicating failure.
</p>

<p>
Let's give these babies a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
Just (2,0)
ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Nice! When we land birds without throwing Pierre off balance, we get a new pole 
wrapped in a <code class="fixed">Just</code>. But when many more birds end up on 
one side of the pole, we get a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. This is cool, 
but we seem to have lost the ability to repeatedly land birds on the pole. We 
can't do <code class="fixed">landLeft 1 (landRight 1 (0,0))</code> anymore 
because when we apply <code class="fixed">landRight 1</code> to <span 
class="fixed">(0,0)</span>, we don't get a <code class="fixed">Pole</code>, but 
a <code class="fixed">Maybe Pole</code>. <code class="fixed">landLeft 1</code> 
takes a <code class="fixed">Pole</code> and not a <span class="fixed">Maybe
Pole</span>.
</p>

<p>
We need a way of taking a <code class="fixed">Maybe Pole</code> and feeding it 
to a function that takes a <code class="fixed">Pole</code> and returns a <span 
class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span>. Luckily, we have <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, 
which does just that for <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>. Let's give it a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landRight 1 (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Just (2,1)
</pre>

<p>
Remember, <code class="fixed">landLeft 2</code> has a type of <span 
class="fixed">Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole</span>. We couldn't just feed it the <span 
class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span> that is the result of <span 
class="fixed">landRight 1 (0,0)</span>, so we use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to take that value with a context and give 
it to <code class="fixed">landLeft 2</code>. <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> does indeed allow us to treat the <span 
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value as a value with context because if we feed a 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code> into <code class="fixed">landLeft 2</code>, 
the result is <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> and the failure is propagated:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
With this, we can now chain landings that may fail because <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> allows us to feed a 
monadic value to a function that takes a normal one.
</p>

<p>
Here's a sequence of birdy landings:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
At the beginning, we used <code class="fixed">return</code> to take a pole and 
wrap it in a <code class="fixed">Just</code>. We could have just applied <span 
class="fixed">landRight 2</span> to <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code>, it would 
have been the same, but this way we can be more consistent by using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
for every function.
<code class="fixed">Just (0,0)</code> gets fed to <span class="fixed">landRight 
2</span>, resulting in <code class="fixed">Just (0,2)</code>. This, in turn, 
gets fed to <code class="fixed">landLeft 2</code>, resulting in <span 
class="fixed">Just (2,2)</span>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Remember this example from before we introduced failure into Pierre's routine:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)
</pre>

<p>
It didn't simulate his interaction with birds very well because in the middle 
there his balance was off but the result didn't reflect that. But let's give 
that a go now by using monadic application (<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>) 
instead of normal application:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= landRight 4 &gt;&gt;= landLeft (-1) &gt;&gt;= landRight (-2)
Nothing
</pre>

<img src="lyah/banana.png" alt="iama banana" class="right" width="262" height="130">

<p>
Awesome. The final result represents failure, which is what we expected. Let's 
see how this result was obtained. First, <code class="fixed">return</code> puts 
 <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code> into a default context, making it a <span 
 class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span>. Then, <span class="fixed">Just (0,0) &gt;&gt;= 
 landLeft 1</span> happens. Since the <code class="fixed">Just (0,0)</code> is a <span 
 class="fixed">Just</span> value, <code class="fixed">landLeft 1</code> gets applied 
 to <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code>, resulting in a <span class="fixed">Just 
 (1,0)</span>, because the birds are still relatively balanced. Next, <span 
 class="fixed">Just (1,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 4</span> takes place and the 
 result is <code class="fixed">Just (1,4)</code> as the balance of the birds is 
 still intact, although just barely. <code class="fixed">Just (1,4)</code> gets 
 fed to <code class="fixed">landLeft (-1)</code>. This means that <span 
 class="fixed">landLeft (-1) (1,4)</span> takes place. Now because of how <span 
 class="fixed">landLeft</span> works, this results in a <span 
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, because the resulting pole is off balance. Now 
 that we have a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, it gets fed to <span 
 class="fixed">landRight (-2)</span>, but because it's a <span 
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the result is automatically <span 
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, as we have nothing to apply <span 
 class="fixed">landRight (-2)</span> to.
</p>

<p>
We couldn't have achieved this by just using <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>
as an applicative. If you try it, you'll get stuck, because applicative functors
don't allow for the applicative values to interact with each other very much. 
They can, at best, be used as parameters to a function by using the applicative 
style. The applicative operators will fetch their results and feed them to the 
function in a manner appropriate for each applicative and then put the final 
applicative value together, but there isn't that much interaction going on 
between them. Here, however, each step relies on the previous one's result. On 
every landing, the possible result from the previous one is examined and the 
pole is checked for balance. This determines whether the landing will succeed or 
fail.
</p>

<p>
We may also devise a function that ignores the current number of birds on the 
balancing pole and just makes Pierre slip and fall. We can call it <span 
class="fixed">banana</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
banana :: Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
banana _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Now we can chain it together with our bird landings. It will always cause our walker 
to fall, because it ignores whatever's passed to it and always returns a 
failure. Check it:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= banana &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The value <code class="fixed">Just (1,0)</code> gets fed to <span 
class="fixed">banana</span>, but it produces a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, which
causes everything to result in a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. How 
unfortunate!
</p>

<p>
Instead of making functions that ignore their input and just return a 
predetermined monadic value, we can use the <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> 
function, whose default implementation is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
m &gt;&gt; n = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; n
</pre>

<p>
Normally, passing some value to a function that ignores its parameter and always 
just returns some predetermined value would always result in that predetermined value. With 
monads however, their context and meaning has to be considered as well. Here's 
how <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> acts with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt; Just 3
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Just 4
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
If you replace <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;= 
\_ -&gt;</span>, it's easy to see why it acts like it does.
</p>

<p>
We can replace our <code class="fixed">banana</code> function in the chain with a <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> and then a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
There we go, guaranteed and obvious failure!
</p>

<p>
It's also worth taking a look at what this would look like if we hadn't made the 
clever choice of treating <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values as values with 
a failure context and feeding them to functions like we did. Here's how a 
series of bird landings would look like: 
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = case landLeft 1 (0,0) of
    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
    Just pole1 -&gt; case landRight 4 pole1 of 
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just pole2 -&gt; case landLeft 2 pole2 of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just pole3 -&gt; landLeft 1 pole3
</pre>

<img src="lyah/centaur.png" alt="john joe glanton" class="right" width="297" height="331">

<p>
We land a bird on the left and then we examine the possibility of failure and 
the possibility of success. In the case of failure, we return a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. In the case of success, we land birds on the 
right and then do the same thing all over again. Converting this monstrosity 
into a neat chain of monadic applications with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
is a classic example of how the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> monad saves us 
a lot of time when we have to successively do computations that are based on 
computations that might have failed.
</p>

<p>
Notice how the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> implementation of <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> features exactly this logic of seeing if a value 
is <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> and if it is, returning a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span> right away and if it isn't, going forward with what's
inside the <code class="fixed">Just</code>.
</p>

<p>
In this section, we took some functions that we had and saw that they would work 
better if the values that they returned supported failure. By turning those 
values into <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values and replacing normal 
function application with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, we got a 
mechanism for handling failure pretty much for free, because <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is supposed to preserve the context of the value 
to which it applies functions. In this case, the context was that our values 
were values with failure and so when we applied functions to such values, the 
possibility of failure was always taken into account.
</p>

<a name="do-notation"></a>
<h2>do notation</h2>

<p>
Monads in Haskell are so useful that they got their own special syntax called 
<code class="fixed">do</code> notation. We've already encountered <span 
class="fixed">do</span> notation when we were doing I/O and there we said that 
it was for gluing together several I/O actions into one. Well, as it turns out, 
<code class="fixed">do</code> notation isn't just for <code class="fixed">IO</code>, but can be used 
for any monad. Its principle is still the same: gluing together monadic
values in sequence. We're going to take a look at how <span 
class="fixed">do</span> notation works and why it's useful.
</p>

<p>
Consider this familiar example of monadic application:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (show x ++ "!"))
Just "3!"
</pre>

<p>
Been there, done that. Feeding a monadic value to a function that returns one, 
no big deal. Notice how when we do this, <code class="fixed">x</code> becomes 
<code class="fixed">3</code> inside the lambda. Once we're inside that lambda, 
it's just a normal value rather than a monadic value. Now, what if we had another 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
inside that function? Check this out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Just "3!"
</pre>

<p>
Ah, a nested use of <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>! In the outermost 
lambda, we feed <code class="fixed">Just "!"</code> to the lambda <span 
class="fixed">\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)</span>. Inside this lambda, the <span 
class="fixed">y</span> becomes <code class="fixed">"!"</code>. <span 
class="fixed">x</span> is still <code class="fixed">3</code> because we got it 
from the outer lambda. All this sort of reminds me of the following expression:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let x = 3; y = "!" in show x ++ y
"3!"
</pre>

<p>
The main difference between these two is that the values in the former example 
are monadic. They're values with a failure context. We can replace any of them 
with a failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Nothing))
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
In the first line, feeding a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> to a function 
naturally results in a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. In the second line, 
we feed <code class="fixed">Just 3</code> to a function and the <span 
class="fixed">x</span> becomes <code class="fixed">3</code>, but then we feed a 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code> to the inner lambda and the result of that is 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, which causes the outer lambda to produce 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code> as well. So this is sort of like assigning 
values to variables in <code class="fixed">let</code> expressions, only that the 
values in question are monadic values.
</p>

<p>
To further illustrate this point, let's write this in a script and have each 
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> value take up its own line:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foo :: Maybe String
foo = Just 3   &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
      Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
      Just (show x ++ y)))
</pre>

<p>
To save us from writing all these annoying lambdas, Haskell gives us
<code class="fixed">do</code> notation. It allows us to write the previous piece 
of code like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foo :: Maybe String
foo = do
    x &lt;- Just 3
    y &lt;- Just "!"
    Just (show x ++ y)
</pre>

<img src="lyah/owld.png" alt="90s owl" class="right" width="269" height="348">

<p>
It would seem as though we've gained the ability to temporarily extract things 
from <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values without having to check if the 
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values are <code class="fixed">Just</code> 
values or <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> values at every step. How cool! If any of the 
values that we try to extract from are <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, the 
whole <code class="fixed">do</code> expression will result in a <span 
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. We're yanking out their (possibly existing) values 
and letting <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> worry about the context that 
comes with those values. It's important to remember that 
<code class="fixed">do</code> expressions are just different syntax for chaining 
monadic values.
</p>

<p>
In a <code class="fixed">do</code> expression, every line is a monadic value. To 
inspect its result, we use <code class="fixed">&lt;-</code>. If we have a 
<code class="fixed">Maybe String</code> and we bind it with <span 
class="fixed">&lt;-</span> to a variable, that variable will be a <span 
class="fixed">String</span>, just like when we used <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>
to feed monadic values to lambdas. The last monadic value in a  <span 
class="fixed">do</span> expression, like <code class="fixed">Just (show x ++ y)</code> here,
can't be used with <code class="fixed">&lt;-</code> to bind its result, because that 
wouldn't make sense if we translated the <code class="fixed">do</code>
expression 
back to a chain of <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> applications. Rather, 
its result is the result of the whole glued up monadic value, taking into 
account the possible failure of any of the previous ones.
</p>

<p>
For instance, examine the following line:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x &gt; 8))
Just True
</pre>

<p>
Because the left parameter of <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> is a 
<code class="fixed">Just</code> value, the lambda is applied to <span 
class="fixed">9</span> and the result is a <code class="fixed">Just True</code>. If we 
rewrite this in <code class="fixed">do</code> notation, we get:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
marySue :: Maybe Bool
marySue = do 
    x &lt;- Just 9
    Just (x &gt; 8)
</pre>

<p>
If we compare these two, it's easy to see why the result of the whole monadic 
value is the result of the last monadic value in the <code class="fixed">do</code> 
expression with all the previous ones chained into it.
</p>

<p>
Our tightwalker's routine can also be expressed with <code class="fixed">do</code>
notation. <code class="fixed">landLeft</code> and <code class="fixed">landRight</code>
take a number of birds and a pole and produce a pole wrapped in a <span 
class="fixed">Just</span>, unless the tightwalker 
slips, in which case a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> is produced. We used 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to chain successive steps because each one 
relied on the previous one and each one had an added context of possible 
failure. Here's two birds landing on the left side, then two birds landing on 
the right and then one bird landing on the left:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
Let's see if he succeeds:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; routine
Just (3,2)
</pre>

<p>
He does! Great. When we were doing these routines by explicitly writing 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, we usually said something like
<code class="fixed">return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2</code>, because 
<code class="fixed">landLeft 2</code> is a function that returns a 
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> value. With <code class="fixed">do</code> 
expressions however, each line must feature a monadic value. So we explicitly pass
the previous <code class="fixed">Pole</code> to the <code class="fixed">landLeft</code>
<code class="fixed">landRight</code> functions. If we examined the variables to 
which we bound our <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values, <span 
class="fixed">start</span> would be <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code>, <span 
class="fixed">first</span> would be <code class="fixed">(2,0)</code> and so on.
</p>

<p>
Because <code class="fixed">do</code> expressions are written line by line, they may look 
like imperative code to some people. But the thing is, they're just sequential, as each value in 
each line relies on the result of the previous ones, along with their contexts 
(in this case, whether they succeeded or failed).
</p>

<p>Again, let's take a look at what this piece of code would look like if we hadn't 
used the monadic aspects of <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>:</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = 
    case Just (0,0) of 
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just start -&gt; case landLeft 2 start of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just first -&gt; case landRight 2 first of
                Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                Just second -&gt; landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
See how in the case of success, the tuple inside <span class="fixed">Just 
(0,0)</span> becomes <code class="fixed">start</code>, the result of
<code class="fixed">landLeft 2 start</code> becomes <code class="fixed">first</code>, etc.
</p>

<p>
If we want to throw the Pierre a banana peel in <code class="fixed">do</code>
notation, we can do the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    Nothing
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
When we write a line in <code class="fixed">do</code> notation without binding 
the monadic value with <code class="fixed">&lt;-</code>, it's just like putting 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> after the monadic value whose result we 
want to ignore. We sequence the monadic value but we ignore its result because 
we don't care what it is and it's prettier than writing
<code class="fixed">_ &lt;- Nothing</code>, which is equivalent to the above.
</p>

<p>
When to use <code class="fixed">do</code> notation and when to explicitly use
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> is up to you. I think this example lends 
itself to explicitly writing <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> because each 
step relies specifically on the result of the previous one. With <span 
class="fixed">do</span> notation, we had to specifically write on which pole the 
birds are landing, but every time we used that came directly before. But still, 
it gave us some insight into <code class="fixed">do</code> notation.
</p>

<p>
In <code class="fixed">do</code> notation, when we bind monadic values to 
names, we can utilize pattern matching, just like in <code class="fixed">let</code> 
expressions and function parameters. Here's an example of pattern matching in a
<code class="fixed">do</code> expression:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
justH :: Maybe Char
justH = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just "hello"
    return x
</pre>

<p>
We use pattern matching to get the first character of the string <code class="fixed">"hello"</code>
and then we present it as the result. So <code class="fixed">justH</code> evaluates to 
<code class="fixed">Just 'h'</code>.
</p>

<p>
What if this pattern matching were to 
fail? When matching on a pattern in a function fails, the next pattern is 
matched. If the matching falls through all the patterns for a given function, an 
error is thrown and our program crashes. On the other hand, failed pattern 
matching in <code class="fixed">let</code> expressions results in an error being 
produced right away, because the mechanism of falling through patterns isn't 
present in <code class="fixed">let</code> expressions. When pattern matching 
fails in a <code class="fixed">do</code> expression, the <span 
class="fixed">fail</span> function is called. It's part of the <span 
class="fixed">Monad</span> type class and it enables failed pattern matching to 
result in a failure in the context of the current monad instead of making our 
program crash. Its default implementation is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fail :: (Monad m) =&gt; String -&gt; m a
fail msg = error msg
</pre>

<p>
So by default it does make our program crash, but monads that incorporate a 
context of possible failure (like <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>) usually 
implement it on their own. For <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, its implemented 
like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fail _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
It ignores the error message and makes a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. So 
when pattern matching fails in a <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> value that's 
written in <code class="fixed">do</code> notation, the whole value results in a 
<code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. This is preferable to having our program 
crash. Here's a <code class="fixed">do</code> expression with a pattern that's 
bound to fail:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
wopwop :: Maybe Char
wopwop = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just ""
    return x
</pre>

<p>
The pattern matching fails, so the effect is the same as if the whole line with 
the pattern was replaced with a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. Let's try 
this out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; wopwop
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The failed pattern matching has caused a failure within the context of our
monad instead of causing a program-wide failure, which is pretty neat.

<h2>The list monad</h2>
<img src="lyah/deadcat.png" alt="dead cat" class="left" width="235" height="230">
<p>
So far, we've seen how <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values can be viewed as 
values with a failure context and how we can incorporate failure handling into 
our code by using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed them to functions.
In this section, we're going to take a look at how to use the monadic aspects of 
lists to bring non-determinism into our code in a clear and readable manner.
</p>

<p>
We've already talked about how lists represent non-deterministic values 
when they're used as applicatives. A value like <code class="fixed">5</code>
is deterministic. It has only one result and we know exactly what it is. On the
other hand, a value like <code class="fixed">[3,8,9]</code> contains several
results, so we can view it as one value that is actually many values at the same
time. Using lists as applicative functors showcases this
non-determinism nicely:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; [10,100,1000]
[10,100,1000,20,200,2000,30,300,3000]
</pre>

<p>
All the possible combinations of multiplying elements from the left list with
elements from the right list are included in the resulting list. When dealing
with non-determinism, there are many choices that we can make, so we just try
all of them, and so the result is a non-deterministic value as well, only it has
many more results.
</p>

<p>
This context of non-determinism translates to monads very nicely. Let's go ahead
and see what the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> instance for lists looks like:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad [] where
    return x = [x]
    xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)
    fail _ = []
</pre>

<p>
<code class="fixed">return</code> does the same thing as <span
class="fixed">pure</span>, so we should already be familiar with
<code class="fixed">return</code> for lists. It takes a value and puts it in a
minimal default context that still yields that value. In other words, it makes a
list that has only that one value as its result. This is useful for when we want
to just wrap a normal value into a list so that it can interact with
non-deterministic values.
</p>

<p>
To understand how <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> works for lists, it's
best if we take a look at it in action to gain some intuition first. <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is about taking a value with a context (a monadic
value) and feeding it to a function that takes a normal value and returns one
that has context. If that function just produced a normal value instead of one
with a context, <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> wouldn't be so useful
because after one use, the context would be lost. Anyway, let's try feeding a
non-deterministic value to a function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [3,4,5] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; [x,-x]
[3,-3,4,-4,5,-5]
</pre>

<p>
When we used <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> with <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span>, the monadic value was fed into the function while
taking care of possible failures. Here, it takes care of non-determinism for us.
<code class="fixed">[3,4,5]</code> is a non-deterministic value and we feed it
into a function that returns a non-deterministic value as well. The result is
also non-deterministic, and it features all the possible results of taking
elements from the list <code class="fixed">[3,4,5]</code> and passing them to
the function <code class="fixed">\x -&gt; [x,-x]</code>. This function takes a
number and produces two results: one negated and one that's unchanged. So when
we use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed this list to the function,
every number is negated and also kept unchanged. The <code class="fixed">x</code>
from the lambda takes on every value from the list that's fed to it.
</p>

<p>
To see how this is achieved, we can just follow the implementation. First, we
start off with the list <code class="fixed">[3,4,5]</code>. Then, we map the
lambda over it and the result is the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
[[3,-3],[4,-4],[5,-5]]
</pre>

<p>
The lambda is applied to every element and we get a list of lists. Finally, we
just flatten the list and voila! We've applied a non-deterministic function to a
non-deterministic value!
</p>

<p>
Non-determinism also includes support for failure. The empty list <span
class="fixed">[]</span> is pretty much the equivalent of <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>, because it signifies the absence of a result.
That's why failing is just defined as the empty list. The error message gets
thrown away. Let's play around with lists that fail:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; ["bad","mad","rad"]
[]
ghci&gt; [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; []
[]
</pre>

<p>
In the first line, an empty list is fed into the lambda. Because the list has no
elements, none of them can be passed to the function and so the result is an
empty list. This is similar to feeding <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> to a
function. In the second line, each element gets passed to the function, but the
element is ignored and the function just returns an empty list. Because the
function fails for every element that goes in it, the result is a failure.
</p>

<p>
Just like with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> values, we can chain several
lists with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, propagating the 
non-determinism:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [1,2] &gt;&gt;= \n -&gt; ['a','b'] &gt;&gt;= \ch -&gt; return (n,ch)
[(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'a'),(2,'b')]
</pre>

<img src="lyah/concatmap.png" alt="concatmap" class="left" width="399" height="340">

<p>
The list <code class="fixed">[1,2]</code> gets bound to <span 
class="fixed">n</span> and <code class="fixed">['a','b']</code> gets bound to
<code class="fixed">ch</code>. Then, we do <code class="fixed">return (n,ch)</code> (or <code class="fixed">[(n,ch)]</code>),
which means taking a pair of <code class="fixed">(n,ch)</code> and putting it in 
a default minimal context. In this case, it's making the smallest possible list  
that still presents <code class="fixed">(n,ch)</code> as the result and features 
as little non-determinism as possible. Its effect on the context is minimal. 
What we're saying here is this: for every element in <code class="fixed">[1,2]</code>, 
go over every element in <code class="fixed">['a','b']</code> and produce a 
tuple of one element from each list.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, because <code class="fixed">return</code> takes a value and 
wraps it  in a minimal context, it doesn't have any extra effect (like failing 
in <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> or resulting in more non-determinism for 
lists) but it does present something as its result.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
When you have non-deterministic values interacting, you can view their 
computation as a tree where every possible result in a list represents a 
separate branch.
</div>

<p>
Here's the previous expression rewritten in <code class="fixed">do</code> notation:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
listOfTuples :: [(Int,Char)]
listOfTuples = do
    n &lt;- [1,2]
    ch &lt;- ['a','b']
    return (n,ch)
</pre>

<p>
This makes it a bit more obvious that <code class="fixed">n</code> takes on 
every value from <code class="fixed">[1,2]</code> and <span 
class="fixed">ch</span> takes on every value from <span 
class="fixed">['a','b']</span>. Just like with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, 
we're extracting the elements from the monadic values and treating them like 
normal values and <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> takes care of the context 
for us. The context in this case is non-determinism.
</p>

<p>
Using lists with <code class="fixed">do</code> notation really reminds me of 
something we've seen before. Check out the following piece of code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ (n,ch) | n &lt;- [1,2], ch &lt;- ['a','b'] ]
[(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'a'),(2,'b')]
</pre>

<p>
Yes! List comprehensions! In our <code class="fixed">do</code> notation example, 
<code class="fixed">n</code> became every result from <code class="fixed">[1,2]</code>
and for every such result, <code class="fixed">ch</code> was assigned a result 
from <code class="fixed">['a','b']</code> and then the final line put <span 
class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> into a default context (a singleton list) to present 
it as the result without introducing any additional non-determinism. In this 
list comprehension, the same thing happened, only we didn't have to write
<code class="fixed">return</code> at the end to present <span 
class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> as the result because the output part of a list 
comprehension did that for us.
</p>

<p>
In fact, list comprehensions are just syntactic sugar for using lists as 
monads. In the end, list comprehensions and lists in <code class="fixed">do</code>
notation translate to using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to do 
computations that feature non-determinism.
</p>

<p>
List comprehensions allow us to filter our output. For instance, we can filter a 
list of numbers to search only for that numbers whose digits contain a <span 
class="fixed">7</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], '7' `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
We apply <code class="fixed">show</code> to <code class="fixed">x</code> to turn 
our number into a string and then we check if the character <span 
class="fixed">'7'</span> is part of that string. Pretty clever. To see how 
filtering in list comprehensions translates to the list monad, we have to check 
out the <code class="fixed">guard</code> function and the <span 
class="fixed">MonadPlus</span> type class. The <code class="fixed">MonadPlus</code> 
type class is for monads that can also act as monoids. Here's its definition:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Monad m =&gt; MonadPlus m where
    mzero :: m a
    mplus :: m a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
</pre>

<p>
<code class="fixed">mzero</code> is synonymous to <code class="fixed">mempty</code>
from the <code class="fixed">Monoid</code> type class and <span 
class="fixed">mplus</span> corresponds to <code class="fixed">mappend</code>. 
Because lists are monoids as well as monads, they can be made an instance of 
this type class:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance MonadPlus [] where
    mzero = []
    mplus = (++)
</pre>

<p>
For lists <code class="fixed">mzero</code> represents a non-deterministic 
computation that has no results at all &mdash; a failed computation. <span 
class="fixed">mplus</span> joins two non-deterministic values into one. The 
<code class="fixed">guard</code> function is defined like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
guard :: (MonadPlus m) =&gt; Bool -&gt; m ()
guard True = return ()
guard False = mzero
</pre>

<p>
It takes a boolean value and if it's <code class="fixed">True</code>, takes a <code class="fixed">()</code> and puts it in a minimal default context 
that still succeeds. Otherwise, it makes a failed monadic value. Here it is in 
action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Just ()
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Nothing
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[()]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[]
</pre>

<p>
Looks interesting, but how is it useful? In the list monad, we use it to filter 
out non-deterministic computations. Observe:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [1..50] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; guard ('7' `elem` show x) &gt;&gt; return x)
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
The result here is the same as the result of our previous list comprehension. 
How does <code class="fixed">guard</code> achieve this? Let's first 
see how <code class="fixed">guard</code> functions in conjunction with <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return "cool" :: [String]
["cool"]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return "cool" :: [String]
[]
</pre>

<p>
If <code class="fixed">guard</code> succeeds, the result contained within it 
is an empty tuple. So then, we use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</code> to ignore 
that empty tuple and present something else as the result. However, if <span 
class="fixed">guard</span> fails, then so will the <span 
class="fixed">return</span> later on, because feeding an empty list to a 
function with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> always results in an empty 
list. A <code class="fixed">guard</code> basically says: if this boolean is 
<code class="fixed">False</code> then produce a failure right here, otherwise 
make a successful value that has a dummy result of <code class="fixed">()</code> 
inside it. All this does is to allow the computation to continue.
</p>

<p>
Here's the previous example rewritten in <code class="fixed">do</code> notation:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
sevensOnly :: [Int]
sevensOnly = do
    x &lt;- [1..50]
    guard ('7' `elem` show x)
    return x
</pre>

<p>
Had we forgotten to present <code class="fixed">x</code> as the final result by 
using <code class="fixed">return</code>, the resulting list would just be a list 
of empty tuples. Here's this again in the form of a list comprehension:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], '7' `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
So filtering in list comprehensions is the same as using <span 
class="fixed">guard</span>.
</p>

<h3>A knight's quest</h3>
<p>
Here's a problem that really lends itself to being solved with non-determinism. 
Say you have a chess board and only one knight piece on it. We want to find out 
if the knight can reach a certain position in three moves. We'll just use a pair 
of numbers to represent the knight's position on the chess board. The first 
number will determine the column he's in and the second number will determine 
the row.
</p>

<img src="lyah/chess.png" alt="hee haw im a horse" class="center" width="760" height="447">

<p>
Let's make a type synonym for the knight's current position on the chess board:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type KnightPos = (Int,Int)
</pre>

<p>
So let's say that the knight starts at <code class="fixed">(6,2)</code>. Can he 
get to <code class="fixed">(6,1)</code> in exactly three moves? Let's see. If we 
start off at <code class="fixed">(6,2)</code> what's the best move to make next? 
I know, how about all of them! We have non-determinism at our disposal, so 
instead of picking one move, let's just pick all of them at once. Here's a 
function that takes the knight's position and returns all of its next moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = do
    (c',r') &lt;- [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
               ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
               ]
    guard (c' `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r' `elem` [1..8])
    return (c',r')
</pre>

<p>
The knight can always take one step horizontally or vertically and two steps 
horizontally or vertically but its movement has to be both horizontal and 
vertical. <code class="fixed">(c',r')</code> takes on every value from the list 
of movements and then <code class="fixed">guard</code> makes sure that the new 
move, <code class="fixed">(c',r')</code> is still on the board. If it it's not, 
it produces an empty list, which causes a failure and <span 
class="fixed">return (c',r')</span> isn't carried out for that position.
</p>

<p>
This function can also be written without the use of lists as a monad, but we 
did it here just for kicks. Here is the same function done with <span 
class="fixed">filter</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = filter onBoard
    [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
    ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
    ]
    where onBoard (c,r) = c `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r `elem` [1..8]
</pre>

<p>
Both of these do the same thing, so pick one that you think looks nicer. Let's 
give it a whirl:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; moveKnight (6,2)
[(8,1),(8,3),(4,1),(4,3),(7,4),(5,4)]
ghci&gt; moveKnight (8,1)
[(6,2),(7,3)]
</pre>

<p>
Works like a charm! We take one position and we just carry out all the possible 
moves at once, so to speak. So now that we have a non-deterministic next position, 
we just use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed it to <span 
class="fixed">moveKnight</span>. Here's a function that takes a position and 
returns all the positions that you can reach from it in three moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
in3 :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
in3 start = do 
    first &lt;- moveKnight start
    second &lt;- moveKnight first
    moveKnight second
</pre>

<p>
If you pass it <code class="fixed">(6,2)</code>, the resulting list is quite 
big, because if there are several ways to reach some position in three moves,
it crops up in the list several times. The above without <span 
class="fixed">do</span> notation:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
in3 start = return start &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight
</pre>

<p>
Using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> once gives us all possible moves from 
the start and then when we use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> the second 
time, for every possible first move, every possible next move is computed, and 
the same goes for the last move.
</p>

<p>
Putting a value in a default context by applying <code class="fixed">return</code> 
to it and then feeding it to a function with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> 
is the same as just normally applying the function to that value, but we did it 
here anyway for style.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's make a function that takes two positions and tells us if you can 
get from one to the other in exactly three steps:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
canReachIn3 :: KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn3 start end = end `elem` in3 start
</pre>

<p>
We generate all the possible positions in three steps and then we see if the 
position we're looking for is among them. So let's see if we can get from
<code class="fixed">(6,2)</code> to <code class="fixed">(6,1)</code> in three 
moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (6,1)
True
</pre>

<p>
Yes! How about from <code class="fixed">(6,2)</code> to <span 
class="fixed">(7,3)</span>?
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (7,3)
False
</pre>

<p>
No! As an exercise, you can change this function so that when you can reach one 
position from the other, it tells you which moves to take. Later on, we'll see 
how to modify this function so that we also pass it the number of moves to take 
instead of that number being hardcoded like it is now.
</p>

<a name="monad-laws"></a>
<h2>Monad laws</h2>

<img src="lyah/judgedog.png" alt="the court finds you guilty of peeing all over 
everything" class="right" width="343" height="170">

<p>
Just like applicative functors, and functors before them, monads come with a few 
laws that all monad instances must abide by. Just because something is made an 
instance of the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> type class doesn't mean that 
it's a monad, it just means that it was made an instance of a type class. For 
a type to truly be a monad, the monad laws must hold for that type. These laws 
allow us to make reasonable assumptions about the type and its behavior.
</p>

<p>
Haskell allows any type to be an instance of any type class as long as the types check 
out. It can't check if the monad laws hold for a type though, so if we're making 
a new instance of the <code class="fixed">Monad</code> type class, we have to be 
reasonably sure that all is well with the monad laws for that type. We can rely 
on the types that come with the standard library to satisfy the laws, but later 
when we go about making our own monads, we're going to have to manually check 
the if the laws hold. But don't worry, they're not complicated.
</p>

<h3>Left identity</h3>

<p>
The first monad law states that if we take a value, put it in a default 
context with <code class="fixed">return</code> and then feed it to a function by 
using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, it's the same as just taking the 
value and applying the function to it. To put it formally:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code class="label law">return x &gt;&gt;= f</code> is the same damn 
    thing as <code class="label law">f x</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you look at monadic values as values with a context and <span 
class="fixed">return</span> as taking a value and putting it in a default 
minimal context that still presents that value as its result, it makes sense, 
because if that context is really minimal, feeding this monadic value to a 
function shouldn't be much different than just applying the function to the 
normal value, and indeed it isn't different at all.
</p>

<p>
For the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> monad <code class="fixed">return</code> 
is defined as <code class="fixed">Just</code>. The <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>
monad is all about possible failure, and if we have a value and want to put it 
in such a context, it makes sense that we treat it as a successful computation 
because, well, we know what the value is. Here's some <span 
class="fixed">return</span> usage with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000))
Just 100003
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000)) 3
Just 100003
</pre>

<p>
For the list monad <code class="fixed">return</code> puts something in a 
singleton list. The <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> implementation for 
lists goes over all the values in the list and applies the function to them, but 
since there's only one value in a singleton list, it's the same as applying the 
function to that value:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return "WoM" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; [x,x,x])
["WoM","WoM","WoM"]
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; [x,x,x]) "WoM"
["WoM","WoM","WoM"]
</pre>

<p>
We said that for <code class="fixed">IO</code>, using <span 
class="fixed">return</span> makes an I/O action that has no side-effects but 
just presents a value as its result. So it makes sense that this law holds for 
<code class="fixed">IO</code> as well.
</p>

<h3>Right identity</h3>

<p>
The second law states that if we have a monadic value and we use <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed it to <code class="fixed">return</code>, 
the result is our original monadic value. Formally:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= return</code> is no different than 
    just <code class="label law">m</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
This one might be a bit less obvious than the first one, but let's take a look 
at why it should hold. When we feed monadic values to functions by using <span 
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, those functions take normal values and return 
monadic ones. <code class="fixed">return</code> is also one such function, if 
you consider its type. Like we said, <code class="fixed">return</code> puts a 
value in a minimal context that still presents that value as its result. This 
means that, for instance, for <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, it doesn't 
introduce any failure and for lists, it doesn't introduce any extra 
non-determinism. Here's a test run for a few monads:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just "move on up" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Just "move on up"
ghci&gt; [1,2,3,4] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
[1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; putStrLn "Wah!" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Wah!
</pre>

<p>
If we take a closer look at the list example, the implementation for 
<code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)
</pre>

<p>
So when we feed <code class="fixed">[1,2,3,4]</code> to 
<code class="fixed">return</code>, first <code class="fixed">return</code>
gets mapped over <code class="fixed">[1,2,3,4]</code>, resulting in 
<code class="fixed">[[1],[2],[3],[4]]</code> and then this gets concatenated and 
we have our original list.
</p>

<p>
Left identity and right identity are basically laws that describe how <span 
class="fixed">return</span> should behave. It's an important function for 
making normal values into monadic ones and it wouldn't be good if the monadic 
value that it produced did a lot of other stuff.
</p>

<h3>Associativity</h3>

<p>
The final monad law says that when we have a chain of monadic function 
applications with <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, it shouldn't matter how 
they're nested. Formally written:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Doing <code class="label law">(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</code> is just like 
    doing <code class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmmm, now what's going on here? We have one monadic value, <span 
class="fixed">m</span> and two monadic functions <code class="fixed">f</code> 
and <code class="fixed">g</code>. When we're doing <span class="fixed">(m 
&gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</span>, we're feeding <code class="fixed">m</code> to <code class="fixed">f</code>, which results in a monadic value. Then, we feed that monadic value to <code class="fixed">g</code>. 
In the expression <code class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</code>, we take a 
monadic value and we feed it to a function that feeds the result of <span 
class="fixed">f x</span> to <code class="fixed">g</code>. It's not easy to see 
how those two are equal, so let's take a look at an example that makes this 
equality a bit clearer.
</p>

<p>
Remember when we had our tightrope walker Pierre walk a rope while birds landed 
on his balancing pole? To simulate birds landing on his balancing pole, we 
made a chain of several functions that might produce failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
We started with <code class="fixed">Just (0,0)</code> and then bound that value 
to the next monadic function, <code class="fixed">landRight 2</code>. The result  
of that was another monadic value which got bound into the next 
monadic function, and so on. If we were to explicitly parenthesize this, we'd 
write:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; ((return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
But we can also write the routine like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
landRight 2 x &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
landLeft 2 y &gt;&gt;= (\z -&gt;
landRight 2 z)))
</pre>

<p>
<code class="fixed">return (0,0)</code> is the same as
<code class="fixed">Just (0,0)</code> and when we feed it to the lambda,
the <code class="fixed">x</code> becomes <code class="fixed">(0,0)</code>.
<code class="fixed">landRight</code> takes a number of birds and a pole (a tuple 
of numbers) and that's what it gets passed. This results in a <span 
class="fixed">Just (0,2)</span> and when we feed this to the next lambda,
<code class="fixed">y</code> is <code class="fixed">(0,2)</code>. This goes on 
until the final bird landing produces a <code class="fixed">Just (2,4)</code>, 
which is indeed the result of the whole expression.
</p>

<p>
So it doesn't matter how you nest feeding values to monadic functions, what 
matters is their meaning. Here's another way to look at this law: consider 
composing two functions, <code class="fixed">f</code> and <span 
class="fixed">g</span>. Composing two functions is implemented like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)
f . g = (\x -&gt; f (g x))
</pre>

<p>
If the type of <code class="fixed">g</code> is <code class="fixed">a -&gt; b</code>
and the type of <code class="fixed">f</code> is <code class="fixed">b -&gt; c</code>, 
we arrange them into a new function which has a type of <span 
class="fixed">a -&gt; c</span>, so that its parameter is passed between those 
functions. Now what if those two functions were monadic, that is, what if the 
values they returned were monadic values? If we had a function of type 
<code class="fixed">a -&gt; m b</code>, we couldn't just pass its result to a 
function of type <code class="fixed">b -&gt; m c</code>, because that function 
accepts a normal <code class="fixed">b</code>, not a monadic one. We could 
however, use <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code> to make that happen. So by 
using <code class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</code>, we can compose two monadic 
functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&lt;=&lt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c)
f &lt;=&lt; g = (\x -&gt; g x &gt;&gt;= f)
</pre>

<p>
So now we can compose two monadic functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f x = [x,-x]
ghci&gt; let g x = [x*3,x*2]
ghci&gt; let h = f &lt;=&lt; g
ghci&gt; h 3
[9,-9,6,-6]
</pre>

<p>
Cool. So what does that have to do with the associativity law? Well, when we 
look at the law as a law of compositions, it states that 
<code class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; (g &lt;=&lt; h)</code> should be the same as
<code class="label law">(f &lt;=&lt; g) &lt;=&lt; h</code>. This is just another 
way of saying that for monads, the nesting of operations shouldn't matter.
</p>

<p>
If we translate the first two laws to use <code class="fixed">&lt;=&lt;</code>,
then the left identity law states that for every monadic function <code class="fixed">f</code>, 
<code class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; return</code>
is the same as writing just <code class="label law">f</code> and the right identity law
says that <code class="label law">return &lt;=&lt; f</code> is also no different from
<code class="label law">f</code>. 
</p>

<p>
This is very similar to how if <code class="fixed">f</code> 
is a normal function, <code class="fixed">(f . g) . h</code> is the same as <code class="fixed">f . (g . h)</code>, <code class="fixed">f . id</code>
is always the same as <code class="fixed">f</code> and <span class="fixed">id . 
f</span>
is also just <code class="fixed">f</code>.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we took a look at the basics of monads and learned how the
<code class="fixed">Maybe</code> monad and the list monad work. In the next 
chapter, we'll take a look at a whole bunch of other cool monads and we'll also 
learn how to make our own.
