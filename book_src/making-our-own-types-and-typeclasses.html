        <h1>Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters, we covered some existing Haskell types and typeclasses. In this chapter, we'll learn how to make our own and how to put them to work!</p>
<a name="algebraic-data-types"></a><h2>Algebraic data types intro</h2>
<p>So far, we've run into a lot of data types. <code class="fixed">Bool</code>, <code class="fixed">Int</code>, <code class="fixed">Char</code>, <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, etc. But how do we make our own? Well, one way is to use the <em>data</em> keyword to define a type. Let's see how the <code class="fixed">Bool</code> type is defined in the standard library.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Bool = False | True
</pre>
<p><code class="fixed">data</code> means that we're defining a new data type. The part before the <code class="fixed">=</code> denotes the type, which is <code class="fixed">Bool</code>. The parts after the <code class="fixed">=</code> are <em>value constructors</em>. They specify the different values that this type can have. The <code class="fixed">|</code> is read as <i>or</i>. So we can read this as: the <code class="fixed">Bool</code> type can have a value of <code class="fixed">True</code> or <code class="fixed">False</code>. Both the type name and the value constructors have to be capital cased.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, we can think of the <code class="fixed">Int</code> type as being defined like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Int = -2147483648 | -2147483647 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 2147483647
</pre>
<img src="lyah/caveman.png" alt="caveman" class="left" width="220" height="215">
<p>The first and last value constructors are the minimum and maximum possible values of <code class="fixed">Int</code>. It's not actually defined like this, the ellipses are here because we omitted a heapload of numbers, so this is just for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p>Now, let's think about how we would represent a shape in Haskell. One way would be to use tuples. A circle could be denoted as <code class="fixed">(43.1, 55.0, 10.4)</code> where the first and second fields are the coordinates of the circle's center and the third field is the radius. Sounds OK, but those could also represent a 3D vector or anything else. A better solution would be to make our own type to represent a shape. Let's say that a shape can be a circle or a rectangle. Here it is:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float 
</pre>
<p>
Now what's this? Think of it like this. The <code class="fixed">Circle</code> value constructor has three fields, which take floats. So when we write a value constructor, we can optionally add some types after it and those types define the values it will contain. Here, the first two fields are the coordinates of its center, the third one its radius. The <code class="fixed">Rectangle</code> value constructor has four fields which accept floats. The first two are the coordinates to its upper left corner and the second two are coordinates to its lower right one.
</p>
<p>Now when I say fields, I actually mean parameters. Value constructors are actually functions that ultimately return a value of a data type. Let's take a look at the type signatures for these two value constructors.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :t Circle
Circle :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
ghci&gt; :t Rectangle
Rectangle :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
</pre>
<p>Cool, so value constructors are functions like everything else. Who would have thought? Let's make a function that takes a shape and returns its surface.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
surface :: Shape -&gt; Float
surface (Circle _ _ r) = pi * r ^ 2
surface (Rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)
</pre>
<p>The first notable thing here is the type declaration. It says that the function takes a shape and returns a float. We couldn't write a type declaration of <code class="fixed">Circle -&gt; Float</code> because <code class="fixed">Circle</code> is not a type, <code class="fixed">Shape</code> is. Just like we can't write a function with a type declaration of <code class="fixed">True -&gt; Int</code>. The next thing we notice here is that we can pattern match against constructors. We pattern matched against constructors before (all the time actually) when we pattern matched against values like <code class="fixed">[]</code> or <code class="fixed">False</code> or <code class="fixed">5</code>, only those values didn't have any fields. We just write a constructor and then bind its fields to names. Because we're interested in the radius, we don't actually care about the first two fields, which tell us where the circle is.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; surface $ Circle 10 20 10
314.15927
ghci&gt; surface $ Rectangle 0 0 100 100
10000.0
</pre>
<p>Yay, it works! But if we try to just print out <code class="fixed">Circle 10 20 5</code> in the prompt, we'll get an error. That's because Haskell doesn't know how to display our data type as a string (yet). Remember, when we try to print a value out in the prompt, Haskell first runs the <code class="fixed">show</code> function to get the string representation of our value and then it prints that out to the terminal. To make our <code class="fixed">Shape</code> type part of the <code class="fixed">Show</code> typeclass, we modify it like this: </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>We won't concern ourselves with deriving too much for now. Let's just say that if we add <code class="fixed">deriving (Show)</code> at the end of a <i>data</i> declaration, Haskell automagically makes that type part of the <code class="fixed">Show</code> typeclass. So now, we can do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Circle 10 20 5
Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0
ghci&gt; Rectangle 50 230 60 90
Rectangle 50.0 230.0 60.0 90.0
</pre>
<p>Value constructors are functions, so we can map them and partially apply them and everything. If we want a list of concentric circles with different radii, we can do this.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; map (Circle 10 20) [4,5,6,6]
[Circle 10.0 20.0 4.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0]
</pre>
<p>Our data type is good, although it could be better. Let's make an intermediate data type that defines a point in two-dimensional space. Then we can use that to make our shapes more understandable.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Point = Point Float Float deriving (Show)
data Shape = Circle Point Float | Rectangle Point Point deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>Notice that when defining a point, we used the same name for the data type and the value constructor. This has no special meaning, although it's common to use the same name as the type if there's only one value constructor. So now the <code class="fixed">Circle</code> has two fields, one is of type <code class="fixed">Point</code> and the other of type <code class="fixed">Float</code>. This makes it easier to understand what's what. Same goes for the rectangle. We have to adjust our <code class="fixed">surface</code> function to reflect these changes.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
surface :: Shape -> Float
surface (Circle _ r) = pi * r ^ 2
surface (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)
</pre>
<p>The only thing we had to change were the patterns. We disregarded the whole point in the circle pattern. In the rectangle pattern, we just used a nested pattern matching to get the fields of the points. If we wanted to reference the points themselves for some reason, we could have used as-patterns.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; surface (Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point 100 100))
10000.0
ghci&gt; surface (Circle (Point 0 0) 24)
1809.5574
</pre>
<p>How about a function that nudges a shape? It takes a shape, the amount to move it on the x axis and the amount to move it on the y axis and then returns a new shape that has the same dimensions, only it's located somewhere else.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
nudge :: Shape -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
nudge (Circle (Point x y) r) a b = Circle (Point (x+a) (y+b)) r
nudge (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) a b = Rectangle (Point (x1+a) (y1+b)) (Point (x2+a) (y2+b))
</pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward. We add the nudge amounts to the points that denote the position of the shape.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; nudge (Circle (Point 34 34) 10) 5 10
Circle (Point 39.0 44.0) 10.0
</pre>
<p>If we don't want to deal directly with points, we can make some auxilliary functions that create shapes of some size at the zero coordinates and then nudge those.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
baseCircle :: Float -&gt; Shape
baseCircle r = Circle (Point 0 0) r

baseRect :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
baseRect width height = Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point width height)
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; nudge (baseRect 40 100) 60 23
Rectangle (Point 60.0 23.0) (Point 100.0 123.0)
</pre>
<p>You can, of course, export your data types in your modules. To do that, just write your type along with the functions you are exporting and then add some parentheses and in them specify the value constructors that you want to export for it, separated by commas. If you want to export all the value constructors for a given type, just write <code class="fixed">..</code>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to export the functions and types that we defined here in a module, we could start it off like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
module Shapes 
( Point(..)
, Shape(..)
, surface
, nudge
, baseCircle
, baseRect
) where
</pre>
<p>By doing <code class="fixed">Shape(..)</code>, we exported all the value constructors for <code class="fixed">Shape</code>, so that means that whoever imports our module can make shapes by using the <code class="fixed">Rectangle</code> and <code class="fixed">Circle</code> value constructors. It's the same as writing <code class="fixed">Shape (Rectangle, Circle)</code>.</p>
<p>We could also opt not to export any value constructors for <code class="fixed">Shape</code> by just writing <code class="fixed">Shape</code> in the export statement. That way, someone importing our module could only make shapes by using the auxilliary functions <code class="fixed">baseCircle</code> and <code class="fixed">baseRect</code>. <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> uses that approach. You can't create a map by doing <code class="fixed">Map.Map [(1,2),(3,4)]</code> because it doesn't export that value constructor. However, you can make a mapping by using one of the auxilliary functions like <code class="fixed">Map.fromList</code>. Remember, value constructors are just functions that take the fields as parameters and return a value of some type (like <code class="fixed">Shape</code>) as a result. So when we choose not to export them, we just prevent the person importing our module from using those functions, but if some other functions that are exported return a type, we can use them to make values of our custom data types.</p>
<p>Not exporting the value constructors of a data types makes them more abstract in such a way that we hide their implementation. Also, whoever uses our module can't pattern match against the value constructors.</p>
<a name="record-syntax"></a><h2>Record syntax</h2>
<img src="lyah/record.png" alt="record" class="right" width="208" height="97">
<p>OK, we've been tasked with creating a data type that describes a person. The info that we want to store about that person is: first name, last name, age, height, phone number, and favorite ice-cream flavor. I don't know about you, but that's all I ever want to know about a person. Let's give it a go!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Person = Person String String Int Float String String deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>O-kay. The first field is the first name, the second is the last name, the third is the age and so on. Let's make a person.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let guy = Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"
ghci&gt; guy
Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"
</pre>
<p>That's kind of cool, although slightly unreadable. What if we want to create a function to get seperate info from a person? A function that gets some person's first name, a function that gets some person's last name, etc. Well, we'd have to define them kind of like this.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
firstName :: Person -&gt; String
firstName (Person firstname _ _ _ _ _) = firstname

lastName :: Person -&gt; String
lastName (Person _ lastname _ _ _ _) = lastname

age :: Person -&gt; Int
age (Person _ _ age _ _ _) = age

height :: Person -&gt; Float
height (Person _ _ _ height _ _) = height

phoneNumber :: Person -&gt; String
phoneNumber (Person _ _ _ _ number _) = number

flavor :: Person -&gt; String
flavor (Person _ _ _ _ _ flavor) = flavor
</pre>
<p>Whew! I certainly did not enjoy writing that! Despite being very cumbersome and BORING to write, this method works.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let guy = Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"
ghci&gt; firstName guy
"Buddy"
ghci&gt; height guy
184.2
ghci&gt; flavor guy
"Chocolate"
</pre>
<p>There must be a better way, you say! Well no, there isn't, sorry.</p>
<p>Just kidding, there is. Hahaha! The makers of Haskell were very smart and anticipated this scenario. They included an alternative way to write data types. Here's how we could achieve the above functionality with record syntax.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     , height :: Float
                     , phoneNumber :: String
                     , flavor :: String
                     } deriving (Show) </pre>
<p>So instead of just naming the field types one after another and separating them with spaces, we use curly brackets. First we write the name of the field, for instance, <code class="fixed">firstName</code> and then we write a double colon <code class="fixed">::</code> (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim, haha) and then we specify the type. The resulting data type is exactly the same. The main benefit of this is that it creates functions that lookup fields in the data type. By using record syntax to create this data type, Haskell automatically made these functions: <code class="fixed">firstName</code>, <code class="fixed">lastName</code>, <code class="fixed">age</code>, <code class="fixed">height</code>, <code class="fixed">phoneNumber</code> and <code class="fixed">flavor</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :t flavor
flavor :: Person -&gt; String
ghci&gt; :t firstName
firstName :: Person -&gt; String
</pre>
<p>There's another benefit to using record syntax. When we derive <code class="fixed">Show</code> for the type, it displays it differently if we use record syntax to define and instantiate the type. Say we have a type that represents a car. We want to keep track of the company that made it, the model name and its year of production. Watch.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Car = Car String String Int deriving (Show)
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967
Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967
</pre>
<p>If we define it using record syntax, we can make a new car like this.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Car = Car {company :: String, model :: String, year :: Int} deriving (Show)
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Car {company="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1967}
Car {company = "Ford", model = "Mustang", year = 1967}
</pre>
<p>When making a new car, we don't have to necessarily put the fields in the proper order, as long as we list all of them. But if we don't use record syntax, we have to specify them in order.</p>
<p>Use record syntax when a constructor has several fields and it's not obvious which field is which. If we make a 3D vector data type by doing <code class="fixed">data Vector = Vector Int Int Int</code>, it's pretty obvious that the fields are the components of a vector. However, in our <code class="fixed">Person</code> and <code class="fixed">Car</code> types, it wasn't so obvious and we greatly benefited from using record syntax.</p>
<a name="type-parameters"></a><h2>Type parameters</h2>
<p>A value constructor can take some values parameters and then produce a new value. For instance, the <code class="fixed">Car</code> constructor takes three values and produces a car value. In a similar manner, <em>type constructors</em> can take types as parameters to produce new types. This might sound a bit too meta at first, but it's not that complicated. If you're familiar with templates in C++, you'll see some parallels. To get a clear picture of what type parameters work like in action, let's take a look at how a type we've already met is implemented.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
</pre>
<img src="lyah/yeti.png" alt="yeti" class="left" width="209" height="260">
<p>The <code class="fixed">a</code> here is the type parameter. And because there's a type parameter involved, we call <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> a type constructor. Depending on what we want this data type to hold when it's not <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, this type constructor can end up producing a type of <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code>, <code class="fixed">Maybe Car</code>, <code class="fixed">Maybe String</code>, etc. No value can have a type of just <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, because that's not a type per se, it's a type constructor. In order for this to be a real type that a value can be part of, it has to have all its type parameters filled up.</p>
<p>So if we pass <code class="fixed">Char</code> as the type parameter to <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, we get a type of <code class="fixed">Maybe Char</code>. The value <code class="fixed">Just 'a'</code> has a type of <code class="fixed">Maybe Char</code>, for example.</p>
<p>You might not know it, but we used a type that has a type parameter before we used <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>. That type is the list type. Although there's some syntactic sugar in play, the list type takes a parameter to produce a concrete type. Values can have an <code class="fixed">[Int]</code> type, a <code class="fixed">[Char]</code> type, a <code class="fixed">[[String]]</code> type, but you can't have a value that just has a type of <code class="fixed">[]</code>.</p>
<p>Let's play around with the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> type.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just "Haha"
Just "Haha"
ghci&gt; Just 84
Just 84
ghci&gt; :t Just "Haha"
Just "Haha" :: Maybe [Char]
ghci&gt; :t Just 84
Just 84 :: (Num t) =&gt; Maybe t
ghci&gt; :t Nothing
Nothing :: Maybe a
ghci&gt; Just 10 :: Maybe Double
Just 10.0
</pre>
<p>Type parameters are useful because we can make different types with them depending on what kind of types we want contained in our data type. When we do <code class="fixed">:t Just "Haha"</code>, the type inference engine figures it out to be of the type <code class="fixed">Maybe [Char]</code>, because if the <code class="fixed">a</code> in the <code class="fixed">Just a</code> is a string, then the <code class="fixed">a</code> in <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> must also be a string.</p>
<p>Notice that the type of <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> is <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code>. Its type is polymorphic. If some function requires a <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code> as a parameter, we can give it a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, because a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> doesn't contain a value anyway and so it doesn't matter. The <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> type can act like a <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code> if it has to, just like <code class="fixed">5</code> can act like an <code class="fixed">Int</code> or a <code class="fixed">Double</code>. Similarly, the type of the empty list is <code class="fixed">[a]</code>. An empty list can act like a list of anything. That's why we can do <code class="fixed">[1,2,3] ++ []</code> and <code class="fixed">["ha","ha","ha"] ++ []</code>.</p>
<p>Using type parameters is very beneficial, but only when using them makes sense. Usually we use them when our data type would work regardless of the type of the value it then holds inside it, like with our <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> type. If our type acts as some kind of box, it's good to use them. We could change our <code class="fixed">Car</code> data type from this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Car = Car { company :: String
               , model :: String
               , year :: Int
               } deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Car a b c = Car { company :: a
                     , model :: b
                     , year :: c 
                     } deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>But would we really benefit? The answer is: probably no, because we'd just end up defining functions that only work on the <code class="fixed">Car String String Int</code> type. For instance, given our first definition of <code class="fixed">Car</code>, we could make a function that displays the car's properties in a nice little text.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
tellCar :: Car -&gt; String
tellCar (Car {company = c, model = m, year = y}) = "This " ++ c ++ " " ++ m ++ " was made in " ++ show y
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let stang = Car {company="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1967}
ghci&gt; tellCar stang
"This Ford Mustang was made in 1967"
</pre>
<p>A cute little function! The type declaration is cute and it works nicely. Now what if <code class="fixed">Car</code> was <code class="fixed">Car a b c</code>?</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
tellCar :: (Show a) =&gt; Car String String a -&gt; String
tellCar (Car {company = c, model = m, year = y}) = "This " ++ c ++ " " ++ m ++ " was made in " ++ show y
</pre>
<p>We'd have to force this function to take a <code class="fixed">Car</code> type of <code class="fixed">(Show a) =&gt; Car String String a</code>. You can see that the type signature is more complicated and the only benefit we'd actually get would be that we can use any type that's an instance of the <code class="fixed">Show</code> typeclass as the type for <code class="fixed">c</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; tellCar (Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967)
"This Ford Mustang was made in 1967"
ghci&gt; tellCar (Car "Ford" "Mustang" "nineteen sixty seven")
"This Ford Mustang was made in \"nineteen sixty seven\""

<p>In real life though, we'd end up using <code class="fixed">Car String String Int</code> most of the time and so it would seem that parameterizing the <code class="fixed">Car</code> type isn't really worth it. We usually use type parameters when the type that's contained inside the data type's various value constructors isn't really that important for the type to work. A list of stuff is a list of stuff and it doesn't matter what the type of that stuff is, it can still work. If we want to sum a list of numbers, we can specify later in the summing function that we specifically want a list of numbers. Same goes for <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>. <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> represents an option of either having nothing or having one of something. It doesn't matter what the type of that something is.</p>

<p>Another example of a parameterized type that we've already met is <code class="fixed">Map k v</code> from <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code>. The <code class="fixed">k</code> is the type of the keys in a map and the <code class="fixed">v</code> is the type of the values. This is a good example of where type parameters are very useful. Having maps parameterized enables us to have mappings from any type to any other type, as long as the type of the key is part of the <code class="fixed">Ord</code> typeclass. If we were defining a mapping type, we could add a typeclass constraint in the <i>data</i> declaration:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data (Ord k) =&gt; Map k v = ...
</pre>
<p>However, it's a very strong convention in Haskell to <em>never add typeclass constraints in data declarations. </em>Why? Well, because we don't benefit a lot, but we end up writing more class constraints, even when we don't need them. If we put or don't put the <code class="fixed">Ord k</code> constraint in the <i>data</i> declaration for <code class="fixed">Map k v</code>, we're going to have to put the constraint into functions that assume the keys in a map can be ordered. But if we don't put the constraint in the data declaration, we don't have to put <code class="fixed">(Ord k) =&gt;</code> in the type declarations of functions that don't care whether the keys can be ordered or not. An example of such a function is <code class="fixed">toList</code>, that just takes a mapping and converts it to an associative list. Its type signature is <code class="fixed">toList :: Map k a -&gt; [(k, a)]</code>. If <code class="fixed">Map k v</code> had a type constraint in its <i>data</i> declaration, the type for <code class="fixed">toList</code> would have to be <code class="fixed">toList :: (Ord k) =&gt; Map k a -&gt; [(k, a)]</code>, even though the function doesn't do any comparing of keys by order.</p>
<p>So don't put type constraints into <i>data</i> declarations even if it seems to make sense, because you'll have to put them into the function type declarations either way.</p>
<p>Let's implement a 3D vector type and add some operations for it. We'll be using a parameterized type because even though it will usually contain numeric types, it will still support several of them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Vector a = Vector a a a deriving (Show)

vplus :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t
(Vector i j k) `vplus` (Vector l m n) = Vector (i+l) (j+m) (k+n)

vectMult :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; t -&gt; Vector t
(Vector i j k) `vectMult` m = Vector (i*m) (j*m) (k*m)

scalarMult :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t -&gt; t
(Vector i j k) `scalarMult` (Vector l m n) = i*l + j*m + k*n
</pre>
<p><code class="fixed">vplus</code> is for adding two vectors together. Two vectors are added just by adding their corresponding components. <code class="fixed">scalarMult</code> is for the scalar product of two vectors and <code class="fixed">vectMult</code> is for multiplying a vector with a scalar. These functions can operate on types of <code class="fixed">Vector Int</code>, <code class="fixed">Vector Integer</code>, <code class="fixed">Vector Float</code>, whatever, as long as the <code class="fixed">a</code> from <code class="fixed">Vector a</code> is from the <code class="fixed">Num</code> typeclass. Also, if you examine the type declaration for these functions, you'll see that they can operate only on vectors of the same type and the numbers involved must also be of the type that is contained in the vectors. Notice that we didn't put a <code class="fixed">Num</code> class constraint in the <i>data</i> declaration, because we'd have to repeat it in the functions anyway.</p>
<p>Once again, it's very important to distinguish between the type constructor and the value constructor. When declaring a data type, the part before the <code class="fixed">=</code> is the type constructor and the constructors after it (possibly separated by <code class="fixed">|</code>'s) are value constructors. Giving a function a type of <code class="fixed">Vector t t t -&gt; Vector t t t -&gt; t</code> would be wrong, because we have to put types in type declaration and the vector <em>type</em> constructor takes only one parameter, whereas the value constructor takes three. Let's play around with our vectors.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">

<p>In the <a href="types-and-typeclasses.html#typeclasses-101">Typeclasses 101</a> section, we explained the basics of typeclasses. We explained that a typeclass is a sort of an interface that defines some behavior. A type can be made an <em>instance</em> of a typeclass if it supports that behavior. Example: the <code class="fixed">Int</code> type is an instance of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass because the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass defines behavior for stuff that can be equated. And because integers can be equated, <code class="fixed">Int</code> is a part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass. The real usefulness comes with the functions that act as the interface for <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, namely <code class="fixed">==</code> and <code class="fixed">/=</code>. If a type is a part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass, we can use the <code class="fixed">==</code> functions with values of that type. That's why expressions like <code class="fixed">4 == 4</code> and <code class="fixed">"foo" /= "bar"</code> typecheck.</p>
<p>We also mentioned that they're often confused with classes in languages like Java, Python, C++ and the like, which then baffles a lot of people. In those languages, classes are a blueprint from which we then create objects that contain state and can do some actions. Typeclasses are more like interfaces. We don't make data from typeclasses. Instead, we first make our data type and then we think about what it can act like. If it can act like something that can be equated, we make it an instance of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass. If it can act like something that can be ordered, we make it an instance of the <code class="fixed">Ord</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll take a look at how we can manually make our types instances of typeclasses by implementing the functions defined by the typeclasses. But right now, let's see how Haskell can automatically make our type an instance of any of the following typeclasses: <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, <code class="fixed">Ord</code>, <code class="fixed">Enum</code>, <code class="fixed">Bounded</code>, <code class="fixed">Show</code>, <code class="fixed">Read</code>. Haskell can derive the behavior of our types in these contexts if we use the <i>deriving</i> keyword when making our data type.</p>
<p>Consider this data type:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     }
</pre>
<p>It describes a person. Let's assume that no two people have the same combination of first name, last name and age. Now, if we have records for two people, does it make sense to see if they represent the same person? Sure it does. We can try to equate them and see if they're equal or not. That's why it would make sense for this type to be part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass. We'll derive the instance.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     } deriving (Eq)
</pre>
<p>When we derive the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> instance for a type and then try to compare two values of that type with <code class="fixed">==</code> or <code class="fixed">/=</code>, Haskell will see if the value constructors match (there's only one value constructor here though) and then it will check if all the data contained inside matches by testing each pair of fields with <code class="fixed">==</code>. There's only one catch though, the types of all the fields also have to be part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass. But since both <code class="fixed">String</code> and <code class="fixed">Int</code> are, we're OK. Let's test our <code class="fixed">Eq</code> instance.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let mikeD = Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}
ghci&gt; let adRock = Person {firstName = "Adam", lastName = "Horovitz", age = 41}
ghci&gt; let mca = Person {firstName = "Adam", lastName = "Yauch", age = 44}
ghci&gt; mca == adRock
False
ghci&gt; mikeD == adRock
False
ghci&gt; mikeD == mikeD
True
ghci&gt; mikeD == Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}
True
</pre>
<p>Of course, since <code class="fixed">Person</code> is now in <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, we can use it as the <code class="fixed">a</code> for all functions that have a class constraint of <code class="fixed">Eq a</code> in their type signature, such as <code class="fixed">elem</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let beastieBoys = [mca, adRock, mikeD]
ghci&gt; mikeD `elem` beastieBoys
True
</pre>
<p>The <code class="fixed">Show</code> and <code class="fixed">Read</code> typeclasses are for things that can be converted to or from strings, respectively. Like with <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, if a type's constructors have fields, their type has to be a part of <code class="fixed">Show</code> or <code class="fixed">Read</code> if we want to make our type an instance of them. Let's make our <code class="fixed">Person</code> data type a part of <code class="fixed">Show</code> and <code class="fixed">Read</code> as well.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     } deriving (Eq, Show, Read)
</pre>
<p>Now we can print a person out to the terminal.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let mikeD = Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}
ghci&gt; mikeD
Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}
ghci&gt; "mikeD is: " ++ show mikeD
"mikeD is: Person {firstName = \"Michael\", lastName = \"Diamond\", age = 43}"
</pre>
<p>Had we tried to print a person on the terminal before making the <code class="fixed">Person</code> data type part of <code class="fixed">Show</code>, Haskell would have complained at us, claiming it doesn't know how to represent a person as a string. But now that we've derived a <code class="fixed">Show</code> instance for it, it does know.</p>
<p><code class="fixed">Read</code> is pretty much the inverse typeclass of <code class="fixed">Show</code>. <code class="fixed">Show</code> is for converting values of our a type to a string, <code class="fixed">Read</code> is for converting strings to values of our type. Remember though, when we use the <code class="fixed">read</code> function, we have to use an explicit type annotation to tell Haskell which type we want to get as a result. If we don't make the type we want as a result explicit, Haskell doesn't know which type we want.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; read "Person {firstName =\"Michael\", lastName =\"Diamond\", age = 43}" :: Person
Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}
</pre>
<p>If we use the result of our <code class="fixed">read</code> later on in a way that Haskell can infer that it should read it as a person, we don't have to use type annotation.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; read "Person {firstName =\"Michael\", lastName =\"Diamond\", age = 43}" == mikeD
True
</pre>
<p>We can also read parameterized types, but we have to fill in the type parameters. So we can't do <code class="fixed">read "Just 't'" :: Maybe a</code>, but we can do <code class="fixed">read "Just 't'" :: Maybe Char</code>.</p>
<p>We can derive instances for the <code class="fixed">Ord</code> type class, 
which is for types that have values that can be ordered. If we compare two 
values of the same type that were made using different constructors, the value 
which was made with a constructor that's defined first is considered smaller. 
For instance, consider the <code class="fixed">Bool</code>
type, which can have a value of either <code class="fixed">False</code> or <span 
class="fixed">True</span>. For the purpose of seeing how it behaves when 
compared, we can think of it as being implemented like 
this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Bool = False | True deriving (Ord)
</pre>
<p>Because the <code class="fixed">False</code> value constructor is specified first and the <code class="fixed">True</code> value constructor is specified after it, we can consider <code class="fixed">True</code> as greater than <code class="fixed">False</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; True `compare` False
GT
ghci&gt; True &gt; False
True
ghci&gt; True &lt; False
False
</pre>
<p>In the <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> data type, the <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> value constructor is specified before the <code class="fixed">Just</code> value constructor, so a value of <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> is always smaller than a value of <code class="fixed">Just something</code>, even if that something is minus one billion trillion. But if we compare two <code class="fixed">Just</code> values, then it goes to compare what's inside them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &lt; Just 100
True
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt; Just (-49999)
False
ghci&gt; Just 3 `compare` Just 2
GT
ghci&gt; Just 100 &gt; Just 50
True
</pre>
<p>But we can't do something like <code class="fixed">Just (*3) > Just (*2)</code>, because <code class="fixed">(*3)</code> and <code class="fixed">(*2)</code> are functions, which aren't instances of <code class="fixed">Ord</code>.</p>
<p>We can easily use algebraic data types to make enumerations and the <code class="fixed">Enum</code> and <code class="fixed">Bounded</code> typeclasses help us with that. Consider the following data type:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday
</pre>
<p>Because all the value constructors are nullary (take no parameters, i.e. fields), we can make it part of the <code class="fixed">Enum</code> typeclass. The <code class="fixed">Enum</code> typeclass is for things that have predecessors and successors. We can also make it part of the <code class="fixed">Bounded</code> typeclass, which is for things that have a lowest possible value and highest possible value. And while we're at it, let's also make it an instance of all the other derivable typeclasses and see what we can do with it.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday 
           deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Bounded, Enum)
</pre>
<p>Because it's part of the <code class="fixed">Show</code> and <code class="fixed">Read</code> typeclasses, we can convert values of this type to and from strings.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Wednesday
Wednesday
ghci&gt; show Wednesday
"Wednesday"
ghci&gt; read "Saturday" :: Day
Saturday
</pre>
<p>Because it's part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> and <code class="fixed">Ord</code> typeclasses, we can compare or equate days.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Saturday == Sunday
False
ghci&gt; Saturday == Saturday
True
ghci&gt; Saturday &gt; Friday
True
ghci&gt; Monday `compare` Wednesday
LT
</pre>
<p>It's also part of <code class="fixed">Bounded</code>, so we can get the lowest and highest day.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; minBound :: Day
Monday
ghci&gt; maxBound :: Day
Sunday
</pre>
<p>It's also an instance of <code class="fixed">Enum</code>. We can get predecessors and successors of days and we can make list ranges from them!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; succ Monday
Tuesday
ghci&gt; pred Saturday
Friday
ghci&gt; [Thursday .. Sunday]
[Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday]
ghci&gt; [minBound .. maxBound] :: [Day]
[Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday]
</pre>
<p>That's pretty awesome.</p>
<a name="type-synonyms"></a><h2>Type synonyms</h2>
<p>
 Previously, we mentioned that when writing types, the <code class="fixed">[Char]</code> and <code class="fixed">String </code> types are equivalent and interchangeable. That's implemented with <em>type synonyms</em>. Type synonyms don't really do anything per se, they're just about giving some types different names so that they make more sense to someone reading our code and documentation. Here's how the standard library defines <code class="fixed">String</code> as a synonym for <code class="fixed">[Char]</code>.
 </p>
 <pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
 type String = [Char]
 </pre>
 <img src="lyah/chicken.png" alt="chicken" class="left" width="169" height="225">
 <p>
 We've introduced the <i>type</i> keyword. The keyword might be misleading to some, because we're not actually making anything new (we did that with the <i>data</i> keyword), but we're just making a synonym for an already existing type.
 </p>
 <p>If we make a function that converts a string to uppercase and call it <code class="fixed">toUpperString</code> or something, we can give it a type declaration of <code class="fixed">toUpperString :: [Char] -&gt; [Char]</code> or <code class="fixed">toUpperString :: String -&gt; String</code>. Both of these are essentially the same, only the latter is nicer to read.</p>
 <p>
 When we were dealing with the <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> module, we first represented a phonebook with an association list before converting it into a map. As we've already found out, an association list is a list of key-value pairs. Let's look at a phonebook that we had.
 </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
phoneBook :: [(String,String)]
phoneBook =    
    [("betty","555-2938")   
    ,("bonnie","452-2928")   
    ,("patsy","493-2928")   
    ,("lucille","205-2928")   
    ,("wendy","939-8282")   
    ,("penny","853-2492")   
    ]</pre>
 <p>We see that the type of <code class="fixed">phoneBook</code> is <code class="fixed">[(String,String)]</code>. That tells us that it's an association list that maps from strings to strings, but not much else. Let's make a type synonym to convey some more information in the type declaration.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type PhoneBook = [(String,String)]
</pre>
<p>Now the type declaration for our phonebook can be <code class="fixed">phoneBook :: PhoneBook</code>. Let's make a type synonym for <code class="fixed">String</code> as well.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type PhoneNumber = String
type Name = String
type PhoneBook = [(Name,PhoneNumber)]
</pre>
<p>Giving the <code class="fixed">String</code> type synonyms is something that Haskell programmers do when they want to convey more information about what strings in their functions should be used as and what they represent.</p>
<p>So now, when we implement a function that takes a name and a number and sees if that name and number combination is in our phonebook, we can give it a very pretty and descriptive type declaration.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
inPhoneBook :: Name -&gt; PhoneNumber -&gt; PhoneBook -&gt; Bool
inPhoneBook name pnumber pbook = (name,pnumber) `elem` pbook
</pre>
<p>If we decided not to use type synonyms, our function would have a type of <code class="fixed">String -&gt; String -&gt; [(String,String)] -&gt; Bool</code>. In this case, the type declaration that took advantage of type synonyms is easier to understand. However, you shouldn't go overboard with them. We introduce type synonyms either to describe what some existing type represents in our functions (and thus our type declarations become better documentation) or when something has a long-ish type that's repeated a lot (like <code class="fixed">[(String,String)]</code>) but represents something more specific in the context of our functions.</p>
<p>Type synonyms can also be parameterized. If we want a type that represents an association list type but still want it to be general so it can use any type as the keys and values, we can do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type AssocList k v = [(k,v)]
</pre>
<p>Now, a function that gets the value by a key in an association list can have a type of <code class="fixed">(Eq k) =&gt; k -&gt; AssocList k v -&gt; Maybe v</code>. <code class="fixed">AssocList</code> is a type constructor that takes two types and produces a concrete type, like <code class="fixed">AssocList Int String</code>, for instance.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Fonzie says:</em> Aaay! When I talk about <i>concrete types</i> I mean like fully applied types like <code class="fixed">Map Int String</code> or if we're dealin' with one of them polymorphic functions, <code class="fixed">[a]</code> or <code class="fixed">(Ord a) =&gt; Maybe a</code> and stuff. And like, sometimes me and the boys say that <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is a type, but we don't mean that, cause every idiot knows <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is a type constructor. When I apply an extra type to <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>, like <code class="fixed">Maybe String</code>, then I have a concrete type. You know, values can only have types that are concrete types! So in conclusion, live fast, love hard and don't let anybody else use your comb!</div>
<p>Just like we can partially apply functions to get new functions, we can partially apply type parameters and get new type constructors from them. Just like we call a function with too few parameters to get back a new function, we can specify a type constructor with too few type parameters and get back a partially applied type constructor. If we wanted a type that represents a map (from <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code>) from integers to something, we could either do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type IntMap v = Map Int v
</pre>
<p>Or we could do it like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type IntMap = Map Int
</pre>
<p>Either way, the <code class="fixed">IntMap</code> type constructor takes one parameter and that is the type of what the integers will point to.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Oh yeah</em>. If you're going to try and implement this, you'll probably going to do a qualified import of <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code>. When you do a qualified import, type constructors also have to be preceeded with a module name. So you'd write <code class="fixed">type IntMap = Map.Map Int</code>.</div>
<p>Make sure that you really understand the distinction between type constructors and value constructors. Just because we made a type synonym called <code class="fixed">IntMap</code> or <code class="fixed">AssocList</code> doesn't mean that we can do stuff like <code class="fixed">AssocList [(1,2),(4,5),(7,9)]</code>. All it means is that we can refer to its type by using different names. We can do <code class="fixed">[(1,2),(3,5),(8,9)] :: AssocList Int Int</code>, which will make the numbers inside assume a type of <code class="fixed">Int</code>, but we can still use that list as we would any normal list that has pairs of integers inside. Type synonyms (and types generally) can only be used in the type portion of Haskell. We're in Haskell's type portion whenever we're defining new types (so in <i>data</i> and <i>type</i> declarations) or when we're located after a <code class="fixed">::</code>. The <code class="fixed">::</code> is in type declarations or in type annotations.</p>
<p>Another cool data type that takes two types as its parameters is the <code class="fixed">Either a b</code> type. This is roughly how it's defined:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Either a b = Left a | Right b deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)
</pre>
<p>It has two value constructors. If the <code class="fixed">Left</code> is used, then its contents are of type <code class="fixed">a</code> and if <code class="fixed">Right</code> is used, then its contents are of type <code class="fixed">b</code>. So we can use this type to encapsulate a value of one type or another and then when we get a value of type <code class="fixed">Either a b</code>, we usually pattern match on both <code class="fixed">Left</code> and <code class="fixed">Right</code> and we different stuff based on which one of them it was. </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Right 20
Right 20
ghci&gt; Left "w00t"
Left "w00t"
ghci&gt; :t Right 'a'
Right 'a' :: Either a Char
ghci&gt; :t Left True
Left True :: Either Bool b
</pre>
<p>So far, we've seen that <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> was mostly used to represent the results of computations that could have either failed or not. But somtimes, <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> isn't good enough because <code class="fixed">Nothing</code> doesn't really convey much information other than that something has failed. That's cool for functions that can fail in only one way or if we're just not interested in how and why they failed. A <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> lookup fails only if the key we were looking for wasn't in the map, so we know exactly what happened. However, when we're interested in how some function failed or why, we usually use the result type of <code class="fixed">Either a b</code>, where <code class="fixed">a</code> is some sort of type that can tell us something about the possible failure and <code class="fixed">b</code> is the type of a successful computation. Hence, errors use the <code class="fixed">Left</code> value constructor while results use <code class="fixed">Right</code>.</p>
<p>An example: a high-school has lockers so that students have some place to put their Guns'n'Roses posters. Each locker has a code combination. When a student wants a new locker, they tell the locker supervisor which locker number they want and he gives them the code. However, if someone is already using that locker, he can't tell them the code for the locker and they have to pick a different one. We'll use a map from <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> to represent the lockers. It'll map from locker numbers to a pair of whether the locker is in use or not and the locker code.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import qualified Data.Map as Map

data LockerState = Taken | Free deriving (Show, Eq)

type Code = String

type LockerMap = Map.Map Int (LockerState, Code)
</pre>
<p>Simple stuff. We introduce a new data type to represent whether a locker is taken or free and we make a type synonym for the locker code. We also make a type synonym for the type that maps from integers to pairs of locker state and code. And now, we're going to make a function that searches for the code in a locker map. We're going to use an <code class="fixed">Either String Code</code> type to represent our result, because our lookup can fail in two ways &mdash; the locker can be taken, in which case we can't tell the code or the locker number might not exist at all. If the lookup fails, we're just going to use a <code class="fixed">String</code> to tell what's happened. </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
lockerLookup :: Int -&gt; LockerMap -&gt; Either String Code
lockerLookup lockerNumber map = 
    case Map.lookup lockerNumber map of 
        Nothing -&gt; Left $ "Locker number " ++ show lockerNumber ++ " doesn't exist!"
        Just (state, code) -&gt; if state /= Taken 
                                then Right code
                                else Left $ "Locker " ++ show lockerNumber ++ " is already taken!"</pre>
<p>We do a normal lookup in the map. If we get a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, we return a value of type <code class="fixed">Left String</code>, saying that the locker doesn't exist at all. If we do find it, then we do an additional check to see if the locker is taken. If it is, return a <code class="fixed">Left</code> saying that it's already taken. If it isn't, then return a value of type <code class="fixed">Right Code</code>, in which we give the student the correct code for the locker. It's actually a <code class="fixed">Right String</code>, but we introduced that type synonym to introduce some additional documentation into the type declaration. Here's an example map:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
lockers :: LockerMap
lockers = Map.fromList 
    [(100,(Taken,"ZD39I"))
    ,(101,(Free,"JAH3I"))
    ,(103,(Free,"IQSA9"))
    ,(105,(Free,"QOTSA"))
    ,(109,(Taken,"893JJ"))
    ,(110,(Taken,"99292"))
    ]
</pre>
<p>Now let's try looking up some locker codes.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 101 lockers
Right "JAH3I"
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 100 lockers
Left "Locker 100 is already taken!"
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 102 lockers
Left "Locker number 102 doesn't exist!"
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 110 lockers
Left "Locker 110 is already taken!"
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 105 lockers
Right "QOTSA"
</pre>
<p>We could have used a <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> to represent the result but then we wouldn't know why we couldn't get the code. But now, we have information about the failure in our result type.</p>
<a name="recursive-data-structures"></a><h2>Recursive data structures</h2>
<img src="lyah/thefonz.png" alt="the fonz" class="right" width="168" height="301">
<p>As we've seen, a constructor in an algebraic data type can have several (or none at all) fields and each field must be of some concrete type. With that in mind, we can make types whose constructors have fields that are of the same type! Using that, we can create recursive data types, where one value of some type contains values of that type, which in turn contain more values of the same type and so on.</p>
<p>Think about this list: <code class="fixed">[5]</code>. That's just syntactic sugar for <code class="fixed">5:[]</code>. On the left side of the <code class="fixed">:</code>, there's a value and on the right side, there's a list. And in this case, it's an empty list. Now how about the list <code class="fixed">[4,5]</code>? Well, that desugars to <code class="fixed">4:(5:[])</code>. Looking at the first <code class="fixed">:</code>, we see that it also has an element on its left side and a list (<code class="fixed">5:[]</code>) on its right side. Same goes for a list like <code class="fixed">3:(4:(5:6:[]))</code>, which could be written either like that or like <code class="fixed">3:4:5:6:[]</code> (because <code class="fixed">:</code> is right-associative) or <code class="fixed">[3,4,5,6]</code>.</p>
<p>We could say that a list can be an empty list or it can be an element joined together with a <code class="fixed">:</code> with another list (that can be either the empty list or not).</p>
<p>Let's use algebraic data types to implement our own list then!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)
</pre>
<p>This reads just like our definition of lists from one of the previous paragraphs. It's either an empty list or a combination of a head with some value and a list. If you're confused about this, you might find it easier to understand in record syntax.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data List a = Empty | Cons { listHead :: a, listTail :: List a} deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)
</pre>
<p>You might also be confused about the <code class="fixed">Cons</code> constructor here. <i>cons</i> is another word for <code class="fixed">:</code>. You see, in lists, <code class="fixed">:</code> is actually a constructor that takes a value and another list and returns a list. We can already use our new list type! In other words, it has two fields. One field is of the type of <code class="fixed">a</code> and the other is of the type <code class="fixed">[a]</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Empty
Empty
ghci&gt; 5 `Cons` Empty
Cons 5 Empty
ghci&gt; 4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty)
Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty)
ghci&gt; 3 `Cons` (4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty))
Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty))
</pre>
<p>We called our <code class="fixed">Cons</code> constructor in an infix manner so you can see how it's just like <code class="fixed">:</code>. <code class="fixed">Empty</code> is like <code class="fixed">[]</code> and <code class="fixed">4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty)</code> is like <code class="fixed">4:(5:[])</code>.</p>
<p>We can define functions to be automatically infix by making them comprised of only special characters. We can also do the same with constructors, since they're just functions that return a data type. So check this out.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
infixr 5 :-:
data List a = Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)
</pre>
<p>First off, we notice a new syntactic construct, the fixity declarations. When we define functions as operators, we can use that to give them a fixity (but we don't have to). A fixity states how tightly the operator binds and whether it's left-associative or right-associative. For instance, <code class="fixed">*</code>'s fixity is <code class="fixed">infixl 7 *</code> and <code class="fixed">+</code>'s fixity is <code class="fixed">infixl 6</code>. That means that they're both left-associative (<code class="fixed">4 * 3 * 2</code> is <code class="fixed">(4 * 3) * 2</code>) but <code class="fixed">*</code> binds tighter than <code class="fixed">+</code>, because it has a greater fixity, so <code class="fixed">5 * 4 + 3</code> is <code class="fixed">(5 * 4) + 3</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we just wrote <code class="fixed">a :-: (List a)</code> instead of <code class="fixed">Cons a (List a)</code>. Now, we can write out lists in our list type like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
(:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 Empty))
ghci&gt; let a = 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; 100 :-: a
(:-:) 100 ((:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 Empty)))
</pre>
<p>When deriving <code class="fixed">Show</code> for our type, Haskell will still display it as if the constructor was a prefix function, hence the parentheses around the operator (remember, <code class="fixed">4 + 3</code> is <code class="fixed">(+) 4 3</code>).</p>
<p>Let's make a function that adds two of our lists together. This is how <code class="fixed">++</code> is defined for normal lists:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
infixr 5  ++
(++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
[]     ++ ys = ys
(x:xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)
</pre>
<p>So we'll just steal that for our own list. We'll name the function <code class="fixed">.++</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
infixr 5  .++
(.++) :: List a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a 
Empty .++ ys = ys
(x :-: xs) .++ ys = x :-: (xs .++ ys)
</pre>
<p>And let's see if it works ...</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let a = 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; let b = 6 :-: 7 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; a .++ b
(:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 ((:-:) 6 ((:-:) 7 Empty))))
</pre>
<p>Nice. Is nice. If we wanted, we could implement all of the functions that operate on lists on our own list type.</p>
<p>Notice how we pattern matched on <code class="fixed">(x :-: xs)</code>. That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on <code class="fixed">:-:</code> because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on <code class="fixed">:</code> because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for <code class="fixed">[]</code>. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like <code class="fixed">8</code> or <code class="fixed">'a'</code>, which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.</p>
<img src="lyah/binarytree.png" alt="binary search tree" class="left" width="323" height="225">
<p>Now, we're going to implement a <em>binary search tree</em>. If you're not familiar with binary search trees from languages like C, here's what they are: an element points to two elements, one on its left and one on its right. The element to the left is smaller, the element to the right is bigger. Each of those elements can also point to two elements (or one, or none). In effect, each element has up to two sub-trees. And a cool thing about binary search trees is that we know that all the elements at the left sub-tree of, say, 5 are going to be smaller than 5. Elements in its right sub-tree are going to be bigger. So if we need to find if 8 is in our tree, we'd start at 5 and then because 8 is greater than 5, we'd go right. We're now at 7 and because 8 is greater than 7, we go right again. And we've found our element in three hops! Now if this were a normal list (or a tree, but really unbalanced), it would take us seven hops instead of three to see if 8 is in there.</p>
<p>Sets and maps from <code class="fixed">Data.Set</code> and <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> are implemented using trees, only instead of normal binary search trees, they use balanced binary search trees, which are always balanced. But right now, we'll just be implementing normal binary search trees.</p>
<p>Here's what we're going to say: a tree is either an empty tree or it's an element that contains some value and two trees. Sounds like a perfect fit for an algebraic data type!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Tree a = EmptyTree | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
</pre>
<p>Okay, good, this is good. Instead of manually building a tree, we're going to make a function that takes a tree and an element and inserts an element. We do this by comparing the value we want to insert to the root node and then if it's smaller, we go left, if it's larger, we go right. We do the same for every subsequent node until we reach an empty tree. Once we've reached an empty tree, we just insert a node with that value instead of the empty tree.</p>
<p>In languages like C, we'd do this by modifying the pointers and values inside the tree. In Haskell, we can't really modify our tree, so we have to make a new sub-tree each time we decide to go left or right and in the end the insertion function returns a completely new tree, because Haskell doesn't really have a concept of pointer, just values. Hence, the type for our insertion function is going to be something like <code class="fixed">a -&gt; Tree a - &gt; Tree a</code>. It takes an element and a tree and returns a new tree that has that element inside. This might seem like it's inefficient but laziness takes care of that problem.</p>
<p>So, here are two functions. One is a utility function for making a singleton tree (a tree with just one node) and a function to insert an element into a tree.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
singleton :: a -&gt; Tree a
singleton x = Node x EmptyTree EmptyTree

treeInsert :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
treeInsert x EmptyTree = singleton x
treeInsert x (Node a left right) 
    | x == a = Node x left right
    | x &lt; a  = Node a (treeInsert x left) right
    | x &gt; a  = Node a left (treeInsert x right)
</pre>
<p>The <code class="fixed">singleton</code> function is just a shortcut for making a node that has something and then two empty sub-trees. In the insertion function, we first have the edge condition as a pattern. If we've reached an empty sub-tree, that means we're where we want and instead of the empty tree, we put a singleton tree with our element. If we're not inserting into an empty tree, then we have to check some things. First off, if the element we're inserting is equal to the root element, just return a tree that's the same. If it's smaller, return a tree that has the same root value, the same right sub-tree but instead of its left sub-tree, put a tree that has our value inserted into it. Same (but the other way around) goes if our value is bigger than the root element.</p> 
<p>Next up, we're going to make a function that checks if some element is in the tree. First, let's define the edge condition. If we're looking for an element in an empty tree, then it's certainly not there. Okay. Notice how this is the same as the edge condition when searching for elements in lists. If we're looking for an element in an empty list, it's not there. Anyway, if we're not looking for an element in an empty tree, then we check some things. If the element in the root node is what we're looking for, great! If it's not, what then? Well, we can take advantage of knowing that all the left elements are smaller than the root node. So if the element we're looking for is smaller than the root node, check to see if it's in the left sub-tree. If it's bigger, check to see if it's in the right sub-tree.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
treeElem :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Bool
treeElem x EmptyTree = False
treeElem x (Node a left right)
    | x == a = True
    | x < a  = treeElem x left
    | x &gt; a  = treeElem x right
</pre>
<p>All we had to do was write up the previous paragraph in code. Let's have some fun with our trees! Instead of manually building one (although we could), we'll use a fold to build up a tree from a list. Remember, pretty much everything that traverses a list one by one and then returns some sort of value can be implemented with a fold! We're going to start with the empty tree and then approach a list from the right and just insert element after element into our accumulator tree. </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let nums = [8,6,4,1,7,3,5]
ghci&gt; let numsTree = foldr treeInsert EmptyTree nums
ghci&gt; numsTree
Node 5 (Node 3 (Node 1 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 4 EmptyTree EmptyTree)) (Node 7 (Node 6 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 8 EmptyTree EmptyTree))</pre>
<p>In that <code class="fixed">foldr</code>, <code class="fixed">treeInsert</code> was the folding function (it takes a tree and a list element and produces a new tree) and <code class="fixed">EmptyTree</code> was the starting accumulator. <code class="fixed">nums</code>, of course, was the list we were folding over.</p>
<p>When we print our tree to the console, it's not very readable, but if we try, we can make out its structure. We see that the root node is 5 and then it has two sub-trees, one of which has the root node of 3 and the other a 7, etc.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; 8 `treeElem` numsTree
True
ghci&gt; 100 `treeElem` numsTree
False
ghci&gt; 1 `treeElem` numsTree
True
ghci&gt; 10 `treeElem` numsTree
False
</pre>
<p>Checking for membership also works nicely. Cool.</p>
<p>So as you can see, algebraic data structures are a really cool and powerful concept in Haskell. We can use them to make anything from boolean values and weekday enumerations to binary search trees and more!</p>
<a name="typeclasses-102"></a><h2>Typeclasses 102</h2>
<img src="lyah/trafficlight.png" alt="tweet" class="right" width="175" height="480">
<p>So far, we've learned about some of the standard Haskell typeclasses and we've seen which types are in them. We've also learned how to automatically make our own types instances of the standard typeclasses by asking Haskell to derive the instances for us. In this section, we're going to learn how to make our own typeclasses and how to make types instances of them by hand.</p>
<p>A quick recap on typeclasses: typeclasses are like interfaces. A typeclass defines some behavior (like comparing for equality, comparing for ordering, enumeration) and then types that can behave in that way are made instances of that typeclass. The behavior of typeclasses is achieved by defining functions or just type declarations that we then implement. So when we say that a type is an instance of a typeclass, we mean that we can use the functions that the typeclass defines with that type.</p>
<p>Typeclasses have pretty much nothing to do with classes in languages like Java or Python. This confuses many people, so I want you to forget everything you know about classes in imperative languages right now.</p>
<p>For example, the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass is for stuff that can be equated. It defines the functions <code class="fixed">==</code> and <code class="fixed">/=</code>. If we have a type (say, <code class="fixed">Car</code>) and comparing two cars with the equality function <code class="fixed">==</code> makes sense, then it makes sense for <code class="fixed">Car</code> to be an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>.</p>
<p>This is how the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> class is defined in the standard prelude:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    x == y = not (x /= y)
    x /= y = not (x == y)
</pre>
<p>Woah, woah, woah! Some new strange syntax and keywords there! Don't worry, this will all be clear in a second. First off, when we write <code class="fixed">class Eq a where</code>, this means that we're defining a new typeclass and that's called <code class="fixed">Eq</code>. The <code class="fixed">a</code> is the type variable and it means that <code class="fixed">a</code> will play the role of the type that we will soon be making an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>. It doesn't have to be called <code class="fixed">a</code>, it doesn't even have to be one letter, it just has to be a lowercase word. Then, we define several functions. It's not mandatory to implement the function bodies themselves, we just have to specify the type declarations for the functions.</p>
<div class="hintbox">Some people might understand this better if we wrote <code class="fixed">class Eq equatable where</code> and then specified the type declarations like <code class="fixed">(==) :: equatable -&gt; equatable -&gt; Bool</code>.</div>
<p>Anyway, we <i>did</i> implement the function bodies for the functions that <code class="fixed">Eq</code> defines, only we defined them in terms of mutual recursion. We said that two instances of <code class="fixed">Eq</code> are equal if they are not different and they are different if they are not equal. We didn't have to do this, really, but we did and we'll see how this helps us soon.</p>
<div class="hintbox">If we have say <code class="fixed">class Eq a where</code> and then define a type declaration within that class like <code class="fixed">(==) :: a -&gt; -a -&gt; Bool</code>, then when we examine the type of that function later on, it will have the type of <code class="fixed">(Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>.</div>
<p>So once we have a class, what can we do with it? Well, not much, really. But once we start making types instances of that class, we start getting some nice functionality. So check out this type:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data TrafficLight = Red | Yellow | Green
</pre>
<p>It defines the states of a traffic light. Notice how we didn't derive any class instances for it. That's because we're going to write up some instances by hand, even though we could derive them for types like <code class="fixed">Eq</code> and <code class="fixed">Show</code>. Here's how we make it an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Eq TrafficLight where
    Red == Red = True
    Green == Green = True
    Yellow == Yellow = True
    _ == _ = False
</pre>
<p>We did it by using the <i>instance</i> keyword. So <i>class</i> is for defining new typeclasses and <i>instance</i> is for making our types instances of typeclasses. When we were defining <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, we wrote <code class="fixed">class Eq a where</code> and we said that <code class="fixed">a</code> plays the role of whichever type will be made an instance later on. We can see that clearly here, because when we're making an instance, we write <code class="fixed">instance Eq TrafficLight where</code>. We replace the <code class="fixed">a</code> with the actual type.</p>
<p>Because <code class="fixed">==</code> was defined in terms of <code class="fixed">/=</code> and vice versa in the <i>class</i> declaration, we only had to overwrite one of them in the instance declaration. That's called the minimal complete definition for the typeclass &mdash; the minimum of functions that we have to implement so that our type can behave like the class advertises. To fulfill the minimal complete definition for <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, we have to overwrite either one of <code class="fixed">==</code> or <code class="fixed">/=</code>. If <code class="fixed">Eq</code> was defined simply like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
</pre>
<p>we'd have to implement both of these functions when making a type an instance of it, because Haskell wouldn't know how these two functions are related. The minimal complete definition would then be: both <code class="fixed">==</code> and <code class="fixed">/=</code>.</p>
<p>You can see that we implemented <code class="fixed">==</code> simply by doing pattern matching. Since there are many more cases where two lights aren't equal, we specified the ones that are equal and then just did a catch-all pattern saying that if it's none of the previous combinations, then two lights aren't equal.</p>
<p>Let's make this an instance of <code class="fixed">Show</code> by hand, too. To satisfy the minimal complete definition for <code class="fixed">Show</code>, we just have to implement its <code class="fixed">show</code> function, which takes a value and turns it into a string.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Show TrafficLight where
    show Red = "Red light"
    show Yellow = "Yellow light"
    show Green = "Green light"
</pre>
<p>Once again, we used pattern matching to achieve our goals. Let's see how it works in action:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Red == Red
True
ghci&gt; Red == Yellow
False
ghci&gt; Red `elem` [Red, Yellow, Green]
True
ghci&gt; [Red, Yellow, Green]
[Red light,Yellow light,Green light]
</pre>
<p>Nice. We could have just derived <code class="fixed">Eq</code> and it would have had the same effect (but we didn't for educational purposes). However, deriving <code class="fixed">Show</code> would have just directly translated the value constructors to strings. But if we want lights to appear like <code class="fixed">"Red light"</code>, then we have to make the instance declaration by hand.</p>
<p>You can also make typeclasses that are subclasses of other typeclasses. The <i>class</i> declaration for <code class="fixed">Num</code> is a bit long, but here's the first part:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class (Eq a) =&gt; Num a where
   ...  </pre>
<p>As we mentioned previously, there are a lot of places where we can cram in class constraints. So this is just like writing <code class="fixed">class Num a where</code>, only we state that our type <code class="fixed">a</code> must be an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>. We're essentially saying that we have to make a type an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code> before we can make it an instance of <code class="fixed">Num</code>. Before some type can be considered a number, it makes sense that we can determine whether values of that type can be equated or not. That's all there is to subclassing really, it's just a class constraint on a <i>class</i> declaration! When defining function bodies in the <i>class</i> declaration or when defining them in <i>instance</i> declarations, we can assume that <code class="fixed">a</code> is a part of <code class="fixed">Eq</code> and so we can use <code class="fixed">==</code> on values of that type.</p>
<p>But how are the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> or list types made as instances of typeclasses? What makes <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> different from, say, <code class="fixed">TrafficLight</code> is that <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> in itself isn't a concrete type, it's a type constructor that takes one type parameter (like <code class="fixed">Char</code> or something) to produce a concrete type (like <code class="fixed">Maybe Char</code>). Let's take a look at the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass again:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    x == y = not (x /= y)
    x /= y = not (x == y) </pre>
<p>From the type declarations, we see that the <code class="fixed">a</code> is used as a concrete type because all the types in functions have to be concrete (remember, you can't have a function of the type <code class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe</code> but you can have a function of <code class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe a</code> or <code class="fixed">Maybe Int -&gt; Maybe String</code>). That's why we can't do something like</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Eq Maybe where
    ...  </pre>
<p>Because like we've seen, the <code class="fixed">a</code> has to be a concrete type but <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> isn't a concrete type. It's a type constructor that takes one parameter and then produces a concrete type. It would also be tedious to write <code class="fixed">instance Eq (Maybe Int) where</code>, <code class="fixed">instance Eq (Maybe Char) where</code>, etc. for every type ever. So we could write it out like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Eq (Maybe m) where
    Just x == Just y = x == y
    Nothing == Nothing = True
    _ == _ = False
      </pre>
<p>This is like saying that we want to make all types of the form <code class="fixed">Maybe something</code> an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>. We actually could have written <code class="fixed">(Maybe something)</code>, but we usually opt for single letters to be true to the Haskell style. The <code class="fixed">(Maybe m)</code> here plays the role of the <code class="fixed">a</code> from <code class="fixed">class Eq a where</code>. While <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> isn't a concrete type, <code class="fixed">Maybe m</code> is. By specifying a type parameter (<code class="fixed">m</code>, which is in lowercase), we said that we want all types that are in the form of <code class="fixed">Maybe m</code>, where <code class="fixed">m</code> is any type, to be an instance of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>.</p>
<p>There's one problem with this though. Can you spot it? We use <code class="fixed">==</code> on the contents of the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> but we have no assurance that what the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> contains can be used with <code class="fixed">Eq</code>! That's why we have to modify our <i>instance</i> declaration like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance (Eq m) =&gt; Eq (Maybe m) where
    Just x == Just y = x == y
    Nothing == Nothing = True
    _ == _ = False
      </pre>
<p>We had to add a class constraint! With this <i>instance</i> declaration, we say this: we want all types of the form <code class="fixed">Maybe m</code> to be part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass, but only those types where the <code class="fixed">m</code> (so what's contained inside the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>) is also a part of <code class="fixed">Eq</code>. This is actually how Haskell would derive the instance too.</p>
<p>Most of the times, class constraints in <i>class</i> declarations are used for making a typeclass a subclass of another typeclass and class constraints in <i>instance</i> declarations are used to express requirements about the contents of some type. For instance, here we required the contents of the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> to also be part of the <code class="fixed">Eq</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>When making instances, if you see that a type is used as a concrete type in the type declarations (like the <code class="fixed">a</code> in <code class="fixed">a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>), you have to supply type parameters and add parentheses so that you end up with a concrete type.</p>
<div class="hintbox">Take into account that the type you're trying to make an instance of will replace the parameter in the <i>class</i> declaration. The <code class="fixed">a</code> from <code class="fixed">class Eq a where</code> will be replaced with a real type when you make an instance, so try mentally putting your type into the function type declarations as well. <code class="fixed">(==) :: Maybe -&gt; Maybe -&gt; Bool</code> doesn't make much sense but <code class="fixed">(==) :: (Eq m) =&gt; Maybe m -&gt; Maybe m -&gt; Bool</code> does. But this is just something to think about, because <code class="fixed">==</code> will always have a type of <code class="fixed">(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>, no matter what instances we make.</div>
<p>Ooh, one more thing, check this out! If you want to see what the instances of a typeclass are, just do <code class="fixed">:info YourTypeClass</code> in GHCI. So typing <code class="fixed">:info Num</code> will show which functions the typeclass defines and it will give you a list of the types in the typeclass. <code class="fixed">:info</code> works for types and type constructors too. If you do <code class="fixed">:info Maybe</code>, it will show you all the typeclasses that <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is an instance of. Also <code class="fixed">:info</code> can show you the type declaration of a function. I think that's pretty cool.</p>
<a name="a-yes-no-typeclass"></a><h2>A yes-no typeclass</h2>
<img src="lyah/yesno.png" alt="yesno" class="left" width="201" height="111">
<p>In JavaScript and some other weakly typed languages, you can put almost anything inside an if expression. For example, you can do all of the following: <code class="fixed">if (0) alert("YEAH!") else alert("NO!")</code>, <code class="fixed">if ("") alert ("YEAH!") else alert("NO!")</code>, <code class="fixed">if (false) alert("YEAH") else alert("NO!)</code>, etc. and all of these will throw an alert of <code class="fixed">NO!</code>. If you do <code class="fixed">if ("WHAT") alert ("YEAH") else alert("NO!")</code>, it will alert a <code class="fixed">"YEAH!"</code> because JavaScript considers non-empty strings to be a sort of true-ish value.</p>
<p>Even though strictly using <code class="fixed">Bool</code> for boolean semantics works better in Haskell, let's try and implement that JavaScript-ish behavior anyway. For fun! Let's start out with a <i>class</i> declaration.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class YesNo a where
    yesno :: a -&gt; Bool
</pre>
<p>Pretty simple. The <code class="fixed">YesNo</code> typeclass defines one function. That function takes one value of a type that can be considered to hold some concept of true-ness and tells us for sure if it's true or not. Notice that from the way we use the <code class="fixed">a</code> in the function, <code class="fixed">a</code> has to be a concrete type.</p>
<p>Next up, let's define some instances. For numbers, we'll assume that (like in JavaScript) any number that isn't 0 is true-ish and 0 is false-ish.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo Int where
    yesno 0 = False
    yesno _ = True
</pre>
<p>Empty lists (and by extensions, strings) are a no-ish value, while non-empty lists are a yes-ish value.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo [a] where
    yesno [] = False
    yesno _ = True
</pre>
<p>Notice how we just put in a type parameter <code class="fixed">a</code> in there to make the list a concrete type, even though we don't make any assumptions about the type that's contained in the list. What else, hmm ... I know, <code class="fixed">Bool</code> itself also holds true-ness and false-ness and it's pretty obvious which is which.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo Bool where
    yesno = id   
</pre>
<p>Huh? What's <code class="fixed">id</code>? It's just a standard library function that takes a parameter and returns the same thing, which is what we would be writing here anyway.</p>
<p>Let's make <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> an instance too.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo (Maybe a) where
    yesno (Just _) = True
    yesno Nothing = False
</pre>
<p>We didn't need a class constraint because we made no assumptions about the contents of the <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>. We just said that it's true-ish if it's a <code class="fixed">Just</code> value and false-ish if it's a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. We still had to write out <code class="fixed">(Maybe a)</code> instead of just <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> because if you think about it, a <code class="fixed">Maybe -&gt; Bool</code> function can't exist (because <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> isn't a concrete type), whereas a <code class="fixed">Maybe a -&gt; Bool</code> is fine and dandy. Still, this is really cool because now, any type of the form <code class="fixed">Maybe something</code> is part of <code class="fixed">YesNo</code> and it doesn't matter what that <code class="fixed">something</code> is.</p>
<p>Previously, we defined a <code class="fixed">Tree a</code> type, that represented a binary search tree. We can say an empty tree is false-ish and anything that's not an empty tree is true-ish.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo (Tree a) where
    yesno EmptyTree = False
    yesno _ = True
</pre>
<p>Can a traffic light be a yes or no value? Sure. If it's red, you stop. If it's green, you go. If it's yellow? Eh, I usually run the yellows because I live for adrenaline.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance YesNo TrafficLight where
    yesno Red = False
    yesno _ = True
</pre>
<p>Cool, now that we have some instances, let's go play!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; yesno $ length []
False
ghci&gt; yesno "haha"

False
ghci&gt; yesno [0,0,0]
True
ghci&gt; :t yesno
yesno :: (YesNo a) =&gt; a -&gt; Bool
</pre>
<p>Right, it works! Let's make a function that mimics the if statement, but it works with <code class="fixed">YesNo</code> values.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
yesnoIf :: (YesNo y) =&gt; y -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
yesnoIf yesnoVal yesResult noResult = if yesno yesnoVal then yesResult else noResult
</pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward. It takes a yes-no-ish value and two things. If the yes-no-ish value is more of a yes, it returns the first of the two things, otherwise it returns the second of them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; yesnoIf [] "YEAH!" "NO!"
"NO!"
ghci&gt; yesnoIf [2,3,4] "YEAH!" "NO!"
"YEAH!"

"NO!"

<a name="the-functor-typeclass"></a><h2>The Functor typeclass</h2>
<p>So far, we've encountered a lot of the typeclasses in the standard library. We've played with <code class="fixed">Ord</code>, which is for stuff that can be ordered. We've palled around with <code class="fixed">Eq</code>, which is for things that can be equated. We've seen <code class="fixed">Show</code>, which presents an interface for types whose values can be displayed as strings. Our good friend <code class="fixed">Read</code> is there whenever we need to convert a string to a value of some type. And now, we're going to take a look at the <code class="label class">Functor</code> typeclass, which is basically for things that can be mapped over. You're probably thinking about lists now, since mapping over lists is such a dominant idiom in Haskell. And you're right, the list type is part of the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>What better way to get to know the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass than to see how it's implemented? Let's take a peek.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>
<img src="lyah/functor.png" alt="I AM FUNCTOOOOR!!!" class="right" width="220" height="441">
<p>Alright. We see that it defines one function, <code class="fixed">fmap</code>, and doesn't provide any default implementation for it. The type of <code class="fixed">fmap</code> is interesting. In the definitions of typeclasses so far, the type variable that played the role of the type in the typeclass was a concrete type, like the <code class="fixed">a</code> in <code class="fixed">(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>. But now, the <code class="fixed">f</code> is not a concrete type (a type that a value can hold, like <code class="fixed">Int</code>, <code class="fixed">Bool</code> or <code class="fixed">Maybe String</code>), but a type constructor that takes one type parameter. A quick refresher example: <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code> is a concrete type, but <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is a type constructor that takes one type as the parameter. Anyway, we see that <code class="fixed">fmap</code> takes a function from one type to another and a functor applied with one type and returns a functor applied with another type.</p>
<p>If this sounds a bit confusing, don't worry. All will be revealed soon when we check out a few examples. Hmm, this type declaration for <code class="fixed">fmap</code> reminds me of something. If you don't know what the type signature of <code class="fixed">map</code> is, it's: <code class="fixed">map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code>.</p>
<p>Ah, interesting! It takes a function from one type to another and a list of one type and returns a list of another type. My friends, I think we have ourselves a functor! In fact, <code class="fixed">map</code> is just a <code class="fixed">fmap</code> that works only on lists. Here's how the list is an instance of the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
</pre>
<p>That's it! Notice how we didn't write <code class="fixed">instance Functor [a] where</code>, because from <code class="fixed">fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>, we see that the <code class="fixed">f</code> has to be a type constructor that takes one type. <code class="fixed">[a]</code> is already a concrete type (of a list with any type inside it), while <code class="fixed">[]</code> is a type constructor that takes one type and can produce types such as <code class="fixed">[Int]</code>, <code class="fixed">[String]</code> or even <code class="fixed">[[String]]</code>.</p>
<p>Since for lists, <code class="fixed">fmap</code> is just <code class="fixed">map</code>, we get the same results when using them on lists.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) [1..3]
[2,4,6]
ghci&gt; map (*2) [1..3]
[2,4,6]
</pre>
<p>What happens when we <code class="fixed">map</code> or <code class="fixed">fmap</code> over an empty list? Well, of course, we get an empty list. It just turns an empty list of type <code class="fixed">[a]</code> into an empty list of type <code class="fixed">[b]</code>.</p>
<p>Types that can act like a box can be functors. You can think of a list as a box that has an infinite amount of little compartments and they can all be empty, one can be full and the others empty or a number of them can be full. So, what else has the properties of being like a box? For one, the <code class="fixed">Maybe a</code> type. In a way, it's like a box that can either hold nothing, in which case it has the value of <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, or it can hold one item, like <code class="fixed">"HAHA"</code>, in which case it has a value of <code class="fixed">Just "HAHA"</code>. Here's how <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is a functor.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap f Nothing = Nothing
</pre>
<p>Again, notice how we wrote <code class="fixed">instance Functor Maybe where</code> instead of <code class="fixed">instance Functor (Maybe m) where</code>, like we did when we were dealing with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> and <code class="fixed">YesNo</code>. <code class="fixed">Functor</code> wants a type constructor that takes one type and not a concrete type. If you mentally replace the <code class="fixed">f</code>s with <code class="fixed">Maybe</code>s, <code class="fixed">fmap</code> acts like a <code class="fixed">(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code> for this particular type, which looks OK. But if you replace <code class="fixed">f</code> with <code class="fixed">(Maybe m)</code>, then it would seem to act like a <code class="fixed">(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe m a -&gt; Maybe m b</code>, which doesn't make any damn sense because <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> takes just one type parameter.</p>
<p>Anyway, the <code class="fixed">fmap</code> implementation is pretty simple. If it's an empty value of <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>, then just return a <code class="fixed">Nothing</code>. If we map over an empty box, we get an empty box. It makes sense. Just like if we map over an empty list, we get back an empty list. If it's not an empty value, but rather a single value packed up in a <code class="fixed">Just</code>, then we apply the function on the contents of the <code class="fixed">Just</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fmap (++ " HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST") (Just "Something serious.")
Just "Something serious. HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST"
ghci&gt; fmap (++ " HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST") Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) (Just 200)
Just 400
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) Nothing
Nothing
</pre>
<p>Another thing that can be mapped over and made an instance of <code class="fixed">Functor</code> is our <code class="fixed">Tree a</code> type. It can be thought of as a box in a way (holds several or no values) and the <code class="fixed">Tree</code> type constructor takes exactly one type parameter. If you look at <code class="fixed">fmap</code> as if it were a function made only for <code class="fixed">Tree</code>, its type signature would look like <code class="fixed">(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b</code>. We're going to use recursion on this one. Mapping over an empty tree will produce an empty tree. Mapping over a non-empty tree will be a tree consisting of our function applied to the root value and its left and right sub-trees will be the previous sub-trees, only our function will be mapped over them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor Tree where
    fmap f EmptyTree = EmptyTree
    fmap f (Node x leftsub rightsub) = Node (f x) (fmap f leftsub) (fmap f rightsub)
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) EmptyTree
EmptyTree
ghci&gt; fmap (*4) (foldr treeInsert EmptyTree [5,7,3,2,1,7])
Node 28 (Node 4 EmptyTree (Node 8 EmptyTree (Node 12 EmptyTree (Node 20 EmptyTree EmptyTree)))) EmptyTree
</pre>
<p>Nice! Now how about <code class="fixed">Either a b</code>? Can this be made a functor? The <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass wants a type constructor that takes only one type parameter but <code class="fixed">Either</code> takes two. Hmmm! I know, we'll partially apply <code class="fixed">Either</code> by feeding it only one parameter so that it has one free parameter. Here's how <code class="fixed">Either a</code> is a functor in the standard libraries:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor (Either a) where
    fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)
    fmap f (Left x) = Left x
</pre>
<p>Well well, what did we do here? You can see how we made <code class="fixed">Either a</code> an instance instead of just <code class="fixed">Either</code>. That's because <code class="fixed">Either a</code> is a type constructor that takes one parameter, whereas <code class="fixed">Either</code> takes two. If <code class="fixed">fmap</code> was specifically for <code class="fixed">Either a</code>, the type signature would then be <code class="fixed">(b -&gt; c) -&gt; Either a b -&gt; Either a c</code> because that's the same as <code class="fixed">(b -&gt; c) -&gt; (Either a) b -&gt; (Either a) c</code>. In the implementation, we mapped in the case of a <code class="fixed">Right</code> value constructor, but we didn't in the case of a <code class="fixed">Left</code>. Why is that? Well, if we look back at how the <code class="fixed">Either a b</code> type is defined, it's kind of like:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
</pre>
<p>Well, if we wanted to map one function over both of them, <code class="fixed">a</code> and <code class="fixed">b</code> would have to be the same type. I mean, if we tried to map a function that takes a string and returns a string and the <code class="fixed">b</code> was a string but the <code class="fixed">a</code> was a number, that wouldn't really work out. Also, from seeing what <code class="fixed">fmap</code>'s type would be if it operated only on <code class="fixed">Either</code> values, we see that the first parameter has to remain the same while the second one can change and the first parameter is actualized by the <code class="fixed">Left</code> value constructor.</p>
<p>This also goes nicely with our box analogy if we think of the <code class="fixed">Left</code> part as sort of an empty box with an error message written on the side telling us why it's empty.</p>
<p>Maps from <code class="fixed">Data.Map</code> can also be made a functor because they hold values (or not!). In the case of <code class="fixed">Map k v</code>, <code class="fixed">fmap</code> will map a function <code class="fixed">v -&gt; v'</code> over a map of type <code class="fixed">Map k v</code> and return a map of type <code class="fixed">Map k v'</code>. </p><div class="hintbox">Note, the <code class="fixed">'</code> has no special meaning in types just like it doesn't have special meaning when naming values. It's used to denote things that are similar, only slightly changed.</div>
<p>Try figuring out how <code class="fixed">Map k</code> is made an instance of <code class="fixed">Functor</code> by yourself!</p>
<p>With the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass, we've seen how typeclasses can represent pretty cool higher-order concepts. We've also had some more practice with partially applying types and making instances. In one of the next chapters, we'll also take a look at some laws that apply for functors.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Just one more thing!</em> Functors should obey some laws so that they may have some properties that we can depend on and not think about too much. If we use <code class="fixed">fmap (+1)</code> over the list <code class="fixed">[1,2,3,4]</code>, we expect the result to be <code class="fixed">[2,3,4,5]</code> and not its reverse, <code class="fixed">[5,4,3,2]</code>. If we use <code class="fixed">fmap (\a -&gt; a)</code> (the identity function, which just returns its parameter) over some list, we expect to get back the same list as a result. For example, if we gave the wrong functor instance to our <code class="fixed">Tree</code> type, using <code class="fixed">fmap</code> over a tree where the left sub-tree of a node only has elements that are smaller than the node and the right sub-tree only has nodes that are larger than the node might produce a tree where that's not the case. We'll go over the functor laws in more detail in one of the next chapters.</div>
<a name="kinds-and-some-type-foo"></a><h2>Kinds and some type-foo</h2>
<img src="lyah/typefoo.png" alt="TYPE FOO MASTER" class="right" width="287" height="400">
<p>Type constructors take other types as parameters to eventually produce concrete types. That kind of reminds me of functions, which take values as parameters to produce values. We've seen that type constructors can be partially applied (<code class="fixed">Either String</code> is a type that takes one type and produces a concrete type, like <code class="fixed">Either String Int</code>), just like functions can. This is all very interesting indeed. In this section, we'll take a look at formally defining how types are applied to type constructors, just like we took a look at formally defining how values are applied to functions by using type declarations. <em>You don't really have to read this section to continue on your magical Haskell quest</em> and if you don't understand it, don't worry about it. However, getting this will give you a very thorough understanding of the type system.</p>
<p>So, values like <code class="fixed">3</code>, <code class="fixed">"YEAH"</code> or <code class="fixed">takeWhile</code> (functions are also values, because we can pass them around and such) each have their own type. Types are little labels that values carry so that we can reason about the values. But types have their own little labels, called <em>kinds</em>. A kind is more or less the type of a type. This may sound a bit weird and confusing, but it's actually a really cool concept.</p>
<p>What are kinds and what are they good for? Well, let's examine the kind of a type by using the <code class="fixed">:k</code> command in GHCI.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Int
Int :: *
</pre>
<p>A star? How quaint. What does that mean? A <code class="fixed">*</code> means that the type is a concrete type. A concrete type is a type that doesn't take any type parameters and values can only have types that are concrete types. If I had to read <code class="fixed">*</code> out loud (I haven't had to do that so far), I'd say <i>star</i> or just <i>type</i>.</p>
<p>Okay, now let's see what the kind of <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> is.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Maybe
Maybe :: * -&gt; *
</pre>
<p>The <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> type constructor takes one concrete type (like <code class="fixed">Int</code>) and then returns a concrete type like <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code>. And that's what this kind tells us. Just like <code class="fixed">Int -&gt; Int</code> means that a function takes an <code class="fixed">Int</code> and returns an <code class="fixed">Int</code>, <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> means that the type constructor takes one concrete type and returns a concrete type. Let's apply the type parameter to <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> and see what the kind of that type is.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Maybe Int
Maybe Int :: *
</pre>
<p>Just like I expected! We applied the type parameter to <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> and got back a concrete type (that's what <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> means. A parallel (although not equivalent, types and kinds are two different things) to this is if we do <code class="fixed">:t isUpper</code> and <code class="fixed">:t isUpper 'A'</code>. <code class="fixed">isUpper</code> has a type of <code class="fixed">Char -&gt; Bool</code> and <code class="fixed">isUpper 'A'</code> has a type of <code class="fixed">Bool</code>, because its value is basically <code class="fixed">True</code>. Both those types, however, have a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code>.</p>
<p>We used <code class="fixed">:k</code> on a type to get its kind, just like we can use <code class="fixed">:t</code> on a value to get its type. Like we said, types are the labels of values and kinds are the labels of types and there are parallels between the two.</p>
<p>Let's look at another kind.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Either
Either :: * -&gt; * -&gt; *
</pre>
<p>Aha, this tells us that <code class="fixed">Either</code> takes two concrete types as type parameters to produce a concrete type. It also looks kind of like a type declaration of a function that takes two values and returns something. Type constructors are curried (just like functions), so we can partially apply them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Either String
Either String :: * -&gt; *
ghci&gt; :k Either String Int
Either String Int :: *

<p>When we wanted to make <code class="fixed">Either</code> a part of the <code class="fixed">Functor</code> typeclass, we had to partially apply it because <code class="fixed">Functor</code> wants types that take only one parameter while <code class="fixed">Either</code> takes two. In other words, <code class="fixed">Functor</code> wants types of kind <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> and so we had to partially apply <code class="fixed">Either</code> to get a type of kind <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> instead of its original kind <code class="fixed">* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. If we look at the definition of <code class="fixed">Functor</code> again</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Functor f where 
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>
<p>we see that the <code class="fixed">f</code> type variable is used as a type that takes one concrete type to produce a concrete type. We know it has to produce a concrete type because it's used as the type of a value in a function. And from that, we can deduce that types that want to be friends with <code class="fixed">Functor</code> have to be of kind <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let's do some type-foo. Take a look at this typeclass that I'm just going to make up right now:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Tofu t where
    tofu :: j a -&gt; t a j
</pre>
<p>Man, that looks weird. How would we make a type that could be an instance of that strange typeclass? Well, let's look at what its kind would have to be. Because <code class="fixed">j a</code> is used as the type of a value that the <code class="fixed">tofu</code> function takes as its parameter, <code class="fixed">j a</code> has to have a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code>. We assume <code class="fixed">*</code> for <code class="fixed">a</code> and so we can infer that <code class="fixed">j</code> has to have a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>. We see that <code class="fixed">t</code> has to produce a concrete value too and that it takes two types. And knowing that <code class="fixed">a</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code> and <code class="fixed">j</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>, we infer that <code class="fixed">t</code> has to have a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code>. So it takes a concrete type (<code class="fixed">a</code>), a type constructor that takes one concrete type (<code class="fixed">j</code>) and produces a concrete type. Wow.</p>
<p>OK, so let's make a type with a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code>. Here's one way of going about it.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Frank a b  = Frank {frankField :: b a} deriving (Show)
</pre>
<p>How do we know this type has a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) - &gt; *</code>? Well, fields in ADTs are made to hold values, so they must be of kind <code class="fixed">*</code>, obviously. We assume <code class="fixed">*</code> for <code class="fixed">a</code>, which means that <code class="fixed">b</code> takes one type parameter and so its kind is <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>. Now we know the kinds of both <code class="fixed">a</code> and <code class="fixed">b</code> and because they're parameters for <code class="fixed">Frank</code>, we see that <code class="fixed">Frank</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code> The first <code class="fixed">*</code> represents <code class="fixed">a</code> and the <code class="fixed">(* -&gt; *)</code> represents <code class="fixed">b</code>. Let's make some <code class="fixed">Frank</code> values and check out their types.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = Just "HAHA"}
Frank {frankField = Just "HAHA"} :: Frank [Char] Maybe
ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = Node 'a' EmptyTree EmptyTree}
Frank {frankField = Node 'a' EmptyTree EmptyTree} :: Frank Char Tree
ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = "YES"}
Frank {frankField = "YES"} :: Frank Char []
</pre>
<p>Hmm. Because <code class="fixed">frankField</code> has a type of form <code class="fixed">a b</code>, its values must have types that are of a similar form as well. So they can be <code class="fixed">Just "HAHA"</code>, which has a type of <code class="fixed">Maybe [Char]</code> or it can have a value of <code class="fixed">['Y','E','S']</code>, which has a type of <code class="fixed">[Char]</code> (if we used our own list type for this, it would have a type of <code class="fixed">List Char</code>). And we see that the types of the <code class="fixed">Frank</code> values correspond with the kind for <code class="fixed">Frank</code>. <code class="fixed">[Char]</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code> and <code class="fixed">Maybe</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>. Because in order to have a value, it has to be a concrete type and thus has to be fully applied, every value of <code class="fixed">Frank blah blaah</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code>.</p>
<p>Making <code class="fixed">Frank</code> an instance of <code class="fixed">Tofu</code> is pretty simple. We see that <code class="fixed">tofu</code> takes a <code class="fixed">j a</code> (so an example type of that form would be <code class="fixed">Maybe Int</code>) and returns a <code class="fixed">t a j</code>. So if we replace <code class="fixed">Frank</code> with <code class="fixed">j</code>, the result type would be <code class="fixed">Frank Int Maybe</code>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Tofu Frank where
    tofu x = Frank x
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; tofu (Just 'a') :: Frank Char Maybe
Frank {frankField = Just 'a'}
ghci&gt; tofu ["HELLO"] :: Frank [Char] []
Frank {frankField = ["HELLO"]}
</pre>
<p>Not very useful, but we did flex our type muscles. Let's do some more type-foo. We have this data type:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Barry t k p = Barry { yabba :: p, dabba :: t k }
</pre>
<p>And now we want to make it an instance of <code class="fixed">Functor</code>. <code class="fixed">Functor</code> wants types of kind <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> but <code class="fixed">Barry</code> doesn't look like it has that kind. What is the kind of <code class="fixed">Barry</code>? Well, we see it takes three type parameters, so it's going to be <code class="fixed">something -&gt; something -&gt; something -&gt; *</code>. It's safe to say that <code class="fixed">p</code> is a concrete type and thus has a kind of <code class="fixed">*</code>. For <code class="fixed">k</code>, we assume <code class="fixed">*</code> and so by extension, <code class="fixed">t</code> has a kind of <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>. Now let's just replace those kinds with the <i>somethings</i> that we used as placeholders and we see it has a kind of <code class="fixed">(* -&gt; *) -&gt; * -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. Let's check that with GHCI.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :k Barry
Barry :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; * -&gt; * -&gt; *
</pre>
<p>Ah, we were right. How satisfying. Now, to make this type a part of <code class="fixed">Functor</code> we have to partially apply the first two type parameters so that we're left with <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code>. That means that the start of the instance declaration will be: <code class="fixed">instance Functor (Barry a b) where</code>. If we look at <code class="fixed">fmap</code> as if it was made specifically for <code class="fixed">Barry</code>, it would have a type of <code class="fixed">fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Barry c d a -&gt; Barry c d b</code>, because we just replace the <code class="fixed">Functor</code>'s <code class="fixed">f</code> with <code class="fixed">Barry c d</code>. The third type parameter from <code class="fixed">Barry</code> will have to change and we see that it's conviniently in its own field.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor (Barry a b) where
    fmap f (Barry {yabba = x, dabba = y}) = Barry {yabba = f x, dabba = y}
</pre>
<p>There we go! We just mapped the <code class="fixed">f</code> over the first field.</p>
<p>In this section, we took a good look at how type parameters work and kind of formalized them with kinds, just like we formalized function parameters with type declarations. We saw that there are interesting parallels between functions and type constructors. They are, however, two completely different things. When working on real Haskell, you usually won't have to mess with kinds and do kind inference by hand like we did now. Usually, you just have to partially apply your own type to <code class="fixed">* -&gt; *</code> or <code class="fixed">*</code> when making it an instance of one of the standard typeclasses, but it's good to know how and why that actually works. It's also interesting to see that types have little types of their own. Again, you don't really have to understand everything we did here to read on, but if you understand how kinds work, chances are that you have a very solid grasp of Haskell's type system.</p>
